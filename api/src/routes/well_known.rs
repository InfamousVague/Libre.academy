//! Apple's domain-verification well-known endpoint.
//!
//! When you configure Sign in with Apple on a Service ID, Apple gives
//! you a small text file (`apple-developer-domain-association.txt`)
//! that must be served at:
//!
//!   https://<your-domain>/.well-known/apple-developer-domain-association.txt
//!
//! Apple fetches that URL when you click "Verify" in the developer
//! portal. We serve the file from disk (path in
//! `APPLE_DOMAIN_ASSOCIATION_FILE` — defaulting to
//! `/etc/libre-api/apple-domain-association.txt`) so a fresh
//! verification token can be dropped in by `scp` without rebuilding
//! the API server.
//!
//! If the file isn't present we 404; Apple's verifier reports the
//! domain as unverified and the user knows to upload the file.
