/// One-shot "start the account fresh" orchestrator.
///
/// Wipes every piece of progress, every cached course, every
/// achievement, every cache that the learner has ever earned or
/// downloaded — then forces a clean re-seed of the bundled / web
/// starter set on the next launch. The only things that survive
/// are the user's PREFERENCES (theme, locale, sign-in token,
/// AI host config) since those are chosen, not earned.

/// Designed to be safe to call from a single button click. Never
/// throws — every step has its own try/catch and feeds into a
/// structured `ResetAccountReport` so the UI can show a precise
/// "what landed, what didn't" toast.
///
/// What it WIPES:
///   - **Local progress** — Tauri SQLite OR IndexedDB completions
///   - **Installed courses** — every `delete_course` IPC on desktop
///     (so first-launch reseed runs again from bundled-packs/), every
///     IDB course record on web (the SEED_VERSION bump alongside this
///     ensures the next page load re-fetches the manifest)
///   - **Ingest cache** — Tauri `cache_clear` so a returning user
///     doesn't see ghost AI-import responses from a previous session
///   - **IDB seed flag** — wiped on web so the next visit re-pulls
///     the manifest into a freshly-emptied IDB
///   - Every progress-shaped localStorage key:
///       fb:achievements:unlocked, fb:achievements:freezes-used,
///       fb:streak-shields:v1, fb:streak-frozen-days:v1,
///       libre-practice-history-v1, libre:practice:records:v1,
///       libre:practice:today:v1, libre:recent-courses:v1,
///       libre:notifications:last-seen-at,
///       libre:open-tabs:v2, fb:catalog-cache-v2
///   - **Cloud progress** — DELETE /libre/progress (best-effort;
///     falls back to local-only if the relay route 404s)
///
/// What it KEEPS (preferences):
///   - Sign-in token + cached user (the account itself isn't deleted —
///     `cloud.deleteAccount()` is the heavier door)
///   - Theme, locale, library/mobile view modes
///   - SFX enabled / volume, dev console flag
///   - AI host config + API keys
///   - Banner dismissals (install / update)
///
/// Caller is expected to `window.location.reload()` after this
/// resolves so the rebooted React tree picks up the empty state
/// (the seed runs on next mount).
