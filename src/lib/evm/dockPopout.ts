/// Popout-window plumbing for the ChainDock — opens the dock in
/// its own OS window so the learner can park it on a second monitor
/// while their tests run in the main editor. Mirrors the pattern in
/// `phonePopout.ts` (Tauri's WebviewWindow on desktop, plain
/// `window.open` fallback on the web build).
///
/// The popped window re-loads the app at `?evmDock=1` and `main.tsx`
/// routes to a tiny `EvmDockPopoutView` that mounts only the dock
/// in popout variant. State is shared via the `evm/chainService`
/// singleton — both windows see the same chain because the runtime
/// chain instance lives in a module-scope variable inside
/// `evm/chainService.ts`.
///
/// Caveat: the SAME-singleton story works only when both windows are
/// in the same WebKit process. In Tauri each WebviewWindow gets its
/// own JS realm, so the popout actually has its own chain singleton
/// — this is fine because the popout only DISPLAYS state; it never
/// drives transactions. The main window owns the chain; the popout
/// reads it via the chainSyncBus that mirrors the snapshot across
/// windows on every snapshot change.
///
/// Lifecycle events: callers (notably `EvmDockBanner`) want to know
/// when the popout opens and closes so they can hide the embedded
/// dock while the secondary window is alive — otherwise we'd render
/// the same chain UI twice. We track that with a tiny in-process
/// listener registry plus per-environment close detection:
///   - Tauri: subscribe to `tauri://destroyed` on the WebviewWindow
///   - Web:   poll `window.closed` on the `window.open()` return value
