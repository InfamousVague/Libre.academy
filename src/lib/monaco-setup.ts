/// Monaco bootstrap — bundles Monaco locally via Vite instead of pulling
/// it from cdn.jsdelivr.net at runtime.
///
/// WHY THIS EXISTS
/// ---------------
/// Originally we configured `@monaco-editor/react`'s loader to fetch
/// Monaco's AMD loader + workers from jsdelivr:
///
///   loader.config({ paths: { vs: "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/.../vs" } });
///
/// That works in `tauri dev` (page served from http://localhost:1420),
/// but in the signed production Tauri webview the page origin is
/// `tauri://localhost`, and:
///
///   1. Cross-origin Web Workers spawned from a CDN URL don't run
///      reliably under Tauri's WebKit — workers need same-origin or a
///      tightly-scoped `worker-src` CSP. The result was a syntax-
///      highlight-less editor that "looked super broken".
///   2. Monaco's AMD loader fetches `vs/loader.js`, then resolves
///      further `vs/...` modules — every additional fetch is another
///      chance to fall foul of the prod CSP.
///
/// The fix is to drop the runtime CDN entirely and let Vite bundle
/// Monaco + its workers as part of our own assets. They ship with the
/// app, load from the `tauri://localhost` origin, and the worker code
/// itself runs from blob: URLs (which we permit via CSP).
///
/// CONTRACT
/// --------
/// This module has top-level side effects:
///   - wires `self.MonacoEnvironment` so Monaco knows where to find
///     each language's worker
///   - calls `loader.config({ monaco })` so `@monaco-editor/react`
///     uses our bundled instance instead of trying to fetch a CDN copy
///
/// IT MUST BE IMPORTED BEFORE ANY MONACO-USING COMPONENT MOUNTS.
/// Putting `import "../../lib/monaco-setup";` at the top of EditorPane
/// and InlineSandbox is enough — those files are evaluated when their
/// module graphs load, which happens before React renders them.
