///   payload sent to the LLM in place of `content` when callers
///   bolster the user's wording with framing the user shouldn't
///   see in their bubble (the Generate flow does this).

///   confidence / tool-call JSON stripping; `rawContent` is the

///   inline tag) hang off the same row so the UI can render

///   `name` so the model can correlate.

///   pause, the user answered, and the answer is now in the
