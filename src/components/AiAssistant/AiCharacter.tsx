          from the paper-design liquid-metal demo's outline
          treatment. The original uses a WebGL shader for the
          flowing-metal effect inside the disc; we render the
          DEFINING piece — the chromatic ring around the disc —
          in pure CSS via a conic-gradient masked into a ring
          shape (see `__ring::before` in AiCharacter.css), and
          rotate it continuously to give the "liquid flowing
          around the orb" feel without bundling a shader runtime
          for a 40px corner button. Sits behind the disc in DOM
          order; `position: absolute` + negative inset on the
          element puts it slightly OUTSIDE the disc's bounds so
          the ring frames the orb rather than sitting inside it. */}

          scale pulse still apply to the whole orb) but clips with
          `overflow: hidden` so the foil only paints inside the
          disc shape. The button itself keeps overflow visible so
          the floating tooltip + the liquid-metal ring above can
          escape the disc edge. */}

            as DARK pigment (the same treatment the parchment
            cert ticket uses). `surface="dark"` would compose
            via plus-lighter, which on a white base saturates
            every channel to 1 and erases the rainbow entirely.
            `excited` flips on while the AI is thinking so the
            foil swings faster — visual echo of the existing
            scale-pulse. Sits below the icon glyph via z-index
            (icon span has `z-index: 1`). */}

            `.libre-ai-character__holo` overrides in AiCharacter.css
            that force the snake mask to render as ONE big centered
            silhouette (mask-size: 100%, mask-repeat: no-repeat)
            instead of the primitive's default tiled sparkle. Net
            effect: the visible snake on the orb IS the rainbow
            (not a solid grey silhouette overlaid on it), which
