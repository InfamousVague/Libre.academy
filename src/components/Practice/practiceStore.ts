/// localStorage-backed store for `PracticeRecord` state.
///
/// Why localStorage instead of the existing `storage` (SQLite /
/// IndexedDB) abstraction: practice state is per-device review
/// metadata, not user-facing content. Trying to round-trip it
/// through the `storage` layer would require a schema migration
/// AND a Tauri command pair, which is overkill for a client-only
/// derivable signal. localStorage is synchronous, zero-config,
/// and survives reloads — exactly what the session runner needs.
///
/// The store exposes a small mutable singleton with three pieces:
///
///   1. `loadAllRecords()` — eager read of every record, returned
///      as a Map keyed by item id. Reads from localStorage once
///      per call (no in-memory cache; the calling React state
///      owns the latest snapshot).
///
///   2. `gradeAttempt(item, correct)` — read the prior record,
///      run the SM-2 scheduler, write back. Returns the new
///      record so the caller can update its UI without re-reading.
///
///   3. `summariseStats(items, records)` — derive `PracticeStats`
///      from a freshly-harvested item list + record map. Pure;
///      no IO. Lives here because the daily-counter math
///      depends on the shape both sides agree on.
///
/// All keys are namespaced under `libre:practice:` so a
/// future reset / migration can wipe the whole namespace cleanly.
