/// Type definitions for the Practice feature.
///
/// Practice is the "review" half of the app's learn → review loop.
/// Lessons themselves are linear and one-shot — once a learner
/// finishes a quiz or blocks puzzle inside a lesson, the regular
/// flow doesn't bring it back. Practice mode harvests every quiz
/// question and blocks puzzle from the courses the learner has
/// touched, scores each one independently, and resurfaces them on
/// a spaced-repetition cadence so retention sticks.
///
/// Two collaborating data shapes:
///
///   - `PracticeItem` — a denormalised, run-time-only projection
///     of one practiceable atom (one quiz question OR one blocks
///     puzzle). Built fresh from the live `Course[]` whenever the
///     view mounts; never persisted.
///
///   - `PracticeRecord` — the per-item learning state (last
///     attempt, ease factor, next due date). Persisted across
///     sessions in localStorage; keyed by `PracticeItem.id`.
///
/// The split lets the harvester remain a pure function over the
/// live course data (so author edits and new books take effect on
/// the next reload without a migration) while still tracking the
/// learner's history across sessions.

/// puzzle from an exercise/mixed lesson.
