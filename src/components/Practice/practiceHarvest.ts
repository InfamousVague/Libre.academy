///
/// Two harvesting principles:
///
///   1. **Pre-filter to "touched" courses.** A learner who has
///      never opened a course shouldn't get its content thrown
///      into their review queue — that defeats the "review what
///      you've learned" framing and dilutes the deck. We treat
///      "the learner has completed at least one lesson in the
///      course" as the inclusion threshold.
///
///   2. **No deep-equality dependency on the Course tree.** Caller
///      `useMemo`s over `[courses, completed]`; we trust those
///      identities. The harvester walks them once, allocates
///      O(items) entries, and returns a fresh array. Cheap enough
///      to re-run on every relevant change.
///
/// The id format is the join key against `PracticeRecord` (see
/// `types.ts`). Keep it stable across author-side reorderings:
///   - quiz items use the question's array index, BUT scoped by
///     the lesson id, so adding a new question above an old one
///     would drift records. The drift is acceptable: the orphan
///     is GC-able by the store, and on net "the new question
///     gets a fresh record" is the right semantics. Fancy
///     content-hash-based ids would buy stability at the cost of
///     two re-attempts on innocent author edits.
///   - blocks items always use the literal `"blocks"` slug —
///     there's exactly one blocks puzzle per exercise lesson.
