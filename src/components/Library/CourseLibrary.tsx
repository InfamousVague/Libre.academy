          badge). Sums the badges into a single click so a learner who

          one-at-a-time.

          `updatingIds`. This avoids re-firing in-flight syncs and
          gives the banner a real-time count as updates complete.

          search/filter controls live now — the hero scrolls away
          with the cards, the controls sticky-pin to the top of the

          competing with the brand band for vertical space.
