///
///   - When a `.academy` (or legacy `.libre` / `.kata`) is being
///     dragged over the app window, render a full-window drop target
///     ("Drop courses here") so the user gets unambiguous feedback
///     that the OS-level drag is being recognised by the right
///     surface.
///   - Once the drop happens, fade to a small bottom-center status
///     pill ("Importing 2 of 5…") that stays up until the queue
///     drains. Non-blocking — the rest of the app is interactable
///     while imports run.
///
/// Both states are decorative: the drop event itself is captured by
/// Tauri's webview, not by this component, so we set `pointer-events:
/// none` on the backdrop. This is the same pattern Slack / VS Code
/// use for drag previews.
