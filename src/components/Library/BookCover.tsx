  // in once the bytes finish landing. The "loaded" state is committed
  // in the layout-effect below — there's NO separate reset effect

  // produced a stomp where the regular useEffect flipped the value
  // back to false after the layout effect's cache-hit set it true.
  const [imageLoaded, setImageLoaded] = useState(false);

  // Combined reset + cached-image probe.
  //
  // Cached-image edge case: when the browser already has the JPEG in
  // its image cache (after prefetchCovers populated it on app boot,
  // after a previous mount of this card, or after the same URL was
  // visible elsewhere on the page), the <img>'s `load` event fires
  // SYNCHRONOUSLY during the render commit — before React attaches
  // its synthetic onLoad listener. The prop's handler never fires,
  // imageLoaded stays false, and the cover stays at the loading-
  // state CSS (filter: blur(16px) + scale(1.05) + opacity 0.65) for
  // the lifetime of the component.
  //
  // Fix: probe `img.complete` (the DOM property that reports "the
  // image's data is already there") via useLayoutEffect — runs
  // post-DOM-mutate, pre-paint, so we commit the correct state
  // before the first paint. Also subsumes the URL-change reset
  // (cold-load path sets imageLoaded=false here) so we never have
  // two effects fighting over the same flag.
  //
  // Why this bug surfaced now: I added a CDN-fallback path in
  // useCourseCover so placeholder books point at HTTPS URLs the
  // browser caches aggressively. On first launch, prefetchCovers
  // primes the cache while the splash is up; by the time Library
  // mounts BookCover, the GETs return synchronously from cache and
  // React loses the load-event race.
