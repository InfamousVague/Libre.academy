/// Slim icon-only rail to the LEFT of the floating sidebar. Holds the
/// app's primary navigation (Library / Sandbox / Discover /
/// Practice / Achievements / Tracks / Trees) plus the persistent
/// footer cluster
/// (Settings + sidebar toggle).
///
/// Why a separate rail instead of more sidebar chrome:
///   - The sidebar collapses entirely when the learner hits Hide
///     Sidebar; with the nav living INSIDE the sidebar, that hid the
///     primary route switcher too. A rail lives outside the sidebar
///     so navigation stays reachable in collapsed mode.
///   - A 56px-wide icon column is much more efficient real estate
///     for nav than the 260px-wide course-tree sidebar — the icons
///     read as a fixed reference column the way macOS sidebars do.
///   - Pinning Settings + the sidebar toggle to the bottom of the
///     rail puts the "infrastructure" controls in a stable corner
///     out of the primary scan path.
///
/// Visual chrome mirrors the sidebar's frosted-glass treatment so the
/// rail and sidebar read as a paired unit despite living in separate
/// containers.

                               cousin of the Achievements browser)
