/// Shared badge-icon picker for the active-course chrome. Two
/// surfaces consume this:
///
///   - `CertStamps` — the row of holographic stamps that used to
///     sit below the MiniCertBanner. Each chapter gets one stamp.
///   - `MiniCertBanner` — the badge punch-hole grid INSIDE the
///     cert body. Each chapter gets one badge cell; completed
///     chapters render as a darkened icon-shaped "punch hole" in
///     the parchment.
///
/// Centralising the icon palette + the chapter-id → icon mapping
/// here means both surfaces show the SAME icon for the same
/// chapter — important for users who'd otherwise see one icon on
/// the cert and a different one on the stamps below it and wonder
/// which is canonical.
