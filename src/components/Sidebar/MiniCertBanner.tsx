/// ticket (src/components/Certificates/CertificateTicket.tsx),

/// real ticket: parchment body on the left, perforated tear-off
/// stub on the right, holographic foil layered over both. Below
/// the ticket, a small metadata block surfaces progress + status
/// in plain text so the artefact doesn't have to carry every
/// piece of information visually.
///
/// Motion brief:
///   - Subtle, ALWAYS-ON ambient drift on the holo foil so the
///     hologram is visible even at rest. No big swings — just
///     enough movement that the rainbow shifts are obvious if
///     you glance at the banner.
///   - Hover does NOT shimmer or wobble. It only enlarges the
///     ticket slightly (scale 1.02) to advertise interactivity.
///     Clicking switches to the certificates page via the
///     `onClick` prop.
///
/// The hover-shimmer treatment from the previous revision was
/// distracting in chrome where the user glances 100x a session;
/// the ambient version keeps the hologram alive without yelling
/// for attention.
