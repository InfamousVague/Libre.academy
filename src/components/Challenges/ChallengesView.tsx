/// Tracks — curated linear learning paths, rendered as a 3D

///
/// The visual is a stack of cards arranged along the camera's
/// Z axis. Wheeling the surface drives a smoothed scroll value;
/// each card's Z is `(baseZ + scroll)` so cards visually fly past
/// the camera as the learner scrolls. Mouse position parallax-
/// tilts the world. Velocity drives a dynamic perspective (FOV)
/// warp so fast scrolls "warp" through the field and slow scrolls
/// read as gentle drift.
///
/// Why hand-rolled instead of a smooth-scroll library: this
/// surface is a single screen with its own scroll pseudo-axis
/// (wheel events instead of the page scrollbar), the math is
/// trivial (lerp + delta), and adding a dep for one component
/// felt wrong. The rAF loop runs only while the surface is
/// mounted + visible.
///
/// Trees were retired in the 2026-05 redesign; tracks are now
/// the sole "outcome-driven sequence" surface. The underlying
/// tree data (`data/trees/`) is still imported here because
/// tracks reference tree node IDs to resolve completion + lesson
/// matches — that data layer is now internal-only.
