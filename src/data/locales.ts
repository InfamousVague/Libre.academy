/// Multi-language translation support for Fishbones-authored courses.
///
/// Translations are stored INLINE on each course / chapter / lesson under
/// a `translations` field keyed by locale. The reader merges the active
/// locale's strings over the original (English) at render time via
/// `localizedCourse` / `localizedLesson` below. Missing keys fall back
/// to English silently — partial translations are first-class.
///
/// Why inline (vs sidecar `*.ru.json` files):
///   - Course bundles ship as a single JSON; one file per locale would
///     mean fanning out the storage layer and the .fishbones archive
///     format. Inline keeps every persistence path unchanged.
///   - The translation surface per lesson is small (a few hundred chars
///     of prose). Five extra locales roughly 6× the body weight, but
///     the largest Fishbones-authored course (HelloTrade, ~96 KB EN)
///     stays under 600 KB even fully translated.
///   - Code, identifiers, and starter/test bodies are NEVER duplicated
///     into translations — only natural-language fields are.
///
/// To add a new locale: extend `SUPPORTED_LOCALES` + `LOCALE_NAMES`,
/// re-run `scripts/translate-course.mjs <courseId> --locales <new>`,
/// and add the country flag to `LOCALE_FLAGS`.

/// Set of all locales the app can switch to. `en` is the source of truth
/// (every Fishbones-authored lesson is authored in English first); the
/// rest are translation overlays. Adding a locale here without also
/// running the translation pipeline just shows the language in the
/// dropdown and falls back to English everywhere — graceful degradation.
