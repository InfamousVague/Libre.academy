/// Learning tracks — Codecademy-style curated career paths through
/// the existing skill trees.
///
/// Where trees model the FULL space of a discipline as a DAG, a
/// TRACK is a hand-picked LINEAR-ISH journey across one or more
/// trees that delivers a specific outcome ("Front-End Engineer",
/// "Smart-Contract Developer"). The point is to give the learner
/// who doesn't yet know what they want to do a small number of
/// strong, opinionated choices instead of forcing them to pick a
/// tree and reverse-engineer a path through it.
///
/// Tracks reuse the SkillNode IDs from their source trees — they
/// don't own their own lesson matches. This means:
///
///   * progress in a track is just `isSkillComplete()` summed
///     across its `steps[]`,
///   * a node completed via a tree counts toward every track that
///     references it,
///   * gaps in the underlying trees automatically surface as gaps
///     in the track.
///
/// Adding a new track:
///   1. Add an entry to `TRACKS` in `index.ts`.
///   2. Each step references a `treeId:nodeId` pair. The treeId
///      must match a tree's `id` in `data/trees/*`; the nodeId
///      must match a `SkillNode.id` inside that tree's `nodes[]`.
///      Mismatches show up in the dev console (see `validateTrack`)
///      so you don't ship a track pointing at a renamed node.
///   3. The first step is the on-ramp — it's the node the "Start
///      track" button drops the learner into.
