/// A path is an ordered list of STAGES. A stage is either:
///   - a single `step` on the trunk, or
///   - a `fork` into named parallel BRANCHES (alternative routes —
///     "pick iOS or Android", "Zig route vs C route"). Branches
///     don't reconverge; each runs to its own end. That keeps the
///     horizontal tree tractable and matches how learning routes
///     actually branch (you pick a specialisation, you don't have
///     to do all of them).
///
/// `courseId`s are verified against the live catalog manifest
/// (`libre.academy/starter-courses/manifest.json`). A step whose
/// course isn't installed renders as an "add from Discover"
/// affordance rather than an error — paths are aspirational maps.
///
/// Icon is a string key resolved in the component (mirrors the
/// `resolveAchievementIcon` indirection) so this module stays free
/// of presentation imports.
