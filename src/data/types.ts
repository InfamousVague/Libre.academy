 * Codecademy-style stack of single-line micro-puzzles. Each card is

 * and moves to the next card. A lesson is a sequence of these
 * micro-puzzles, each drilling a single concept (function name,
 * key keyword, magic number).
 *
 * Why this exists alongside ClozeLesson: cloze puts the whole
 * solution on screen with multiple blanks scattered through it,
 * which is overwhelming on a phone (and doesn't fit on a watch).
 * Micro-puzzles flip the proportions — one line at a time, big
 * type, big tap targets, fast feedback. Same data shape works on
 * iPhone and Apple Watch since each card is self-contained.
 *
 * Authored, not auto-derived. The auto-cloze generator was good
 * for shape but bad for pedagogical signal — picking which tokens
 * matter requires understanding the lesson, which an LLM-or-author
 * pass does much better than regex heuristics. See
 * `scripts/generate-micropuzzles.mjs` for the LLM-assisted authoring
 * pipeline.
 *
 * Pre-rendered Shiki HTML lives in `lineHtml` so phone + watch don't
 * need to bundle a syntax highlighter at runtime — the build pre-
 * tokenises and the client just inlines the HTML around the slot
 * markers. This keeps the watch bundle tiny and renders are instant.
