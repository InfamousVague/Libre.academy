///
/// V7 — adds `bun-fundamentals` to the legacy prune list. It was

/// packs. The other ~25 books are still available via the catalog
/// browser but no longer auto-seed on first visit. Returning
/// visitors who had the V8 seed get the dropped books removed

///
/// V11 — Re-seed for blocks restoration. The deployed
/// `/learn/starter-courses/<id>.json` files now carry blocks data
/// (the build:web → blocks:apply chain bakes them in on every
/// build), but returning visitors whose IndexedDB was seeded from
/// V10 have blocks-free copies — every exercise on web mobile shows
/// "this exercise hasn't been authored for blocks mode yet" because
/// `lesson.blocks` is undefined in the cached records. Bumping
/// forces a fresh fetch of the deployed JSONs so existing visitors
/// pick up the blocks payloads without an IndexedDB reset.
///
/// V12 — Hellotrade unhide. The manifest's `hidden: true` flag was
/// stamped onto the IDB record at seed time (see the `hidden:` line
/// in the loop below). Returning visitors who seeded under V11 still
/// have `hidden: true` on the cached record and thus on

/// learning-svelte, solidjs-fundamentals, htmx-fundamentals,

/// have these IDB-cached from V12 — bumping forces a re-seed pass
/// whose `currentIds` set excludes the dropped books, and the
/// existing prune step removes the orphaned IDB rows.
///
/// V14 — Rustlings + Ziglings ingest. Imported the upstream
/// Rustlings (94 exercises) and Ziglings (116 exercises) curricula
/// as two new starter courses (`rustlings-curriculum` /
/// `ziglings-curriculum`), each shipped with a custom cover JPEG
/// from the docs/cover-prompts.md style sheet. Bumping so returning
/// visitors re-fetch the manifest and pick up the two new entries
/// + their covers without waiting for the next seed-altering change.
///
/// V15 — Rustlings + Ziglings unit tests. The V14 ingest left
/// every exercise's `tests` field empty, which on the Zig runner
/// meant the workbench never lit up a pass pill — `runZig`'s
/// legacy harness only synthesises a "program exited cleanly"
/// result when KATA_TEST markers are absent, and the run-mode
/// fallback returns an empty test list. Rustlings inherited the
/// same gap. V15 fills `tests` for every exercise: Rustlings
/// hoists the upstream `#[cfg(test)] mod tests { ... }` block
/// into the lesson tests (52 exercises) with a synthetic
/// `rustlings_compiles` fallback for compile-only ones (42
/// exercises); Ziglings synthesises a `test "<name> — <expected
/// output>" { ... }` block per file that gates on compilation
/// and surfaces the expected stdout in the test title so the
/// learner has a visible target to eyeball their Run output
/// against. Bumping so returning visitors re-fetch.
///
/// V16 — Rustlings + Ziglings rename. Slug-renamed
/// `rustlings-curriculum` → `rustlings` and `ziglings-curriculum`
/// → `ziglings` to match the public URL slugs at
/// `libre.academy/courses/rustlings` + `/courses/ziglings`. The
/// old ids were added to `LEGACY_STARTER_IDS` above so the
/// V16 re-seed pass prunes the IDB rows that the V14/V15 seed
/// wrote, before installing the renamed copies. Without this
/// step, returning visitors would end up with both ids — a
/// "Rustlings curriculum" entry next to the new "Rustlings"
/// entry in their library.
///
/// V17 — Verification + content fixes:
///   • Rustlings `intro1`: solution now mirrors the upstream
///     starter verbatim (the canonical "no edit needed" lesson)
///     so the cargo test compile produces meaningful output
///     instead of the trivial empty-main the importer emitted.
///   • Rustlings `hashmaps3`: the test-suite's `RESULTS`
///     const was a multi-line string literal; the runtime's
///     `indent(testCode, 4)` was prepending 4 spaces to every
///     continuation line and silently corrupting the string
///     contents (team-name keys like "France" became
///     "    France"). Single-line `\n`-escaped literal sidesteps
///     the indenter entirely.
///   • Rustlings `smart-pointers3`: starter ships
///     `#![forbid(unused_imports)]`; `forbid` overrules `allow`,
///     so the wrapper's `#[allow(unused_imports)] use super::*;`
///     couldn't suppress the lint on the compile-only test.
///     Fixed by having the test reference `main` via the glob,
///     making the import genuinely used.
///   • Ziglings: re-imported with a fuzz-locating unified-diff
///     applier. The upstream patches were generated against an
///     older starter snapshot with line offsets shifted ±1 in
///     places; the naive splice was mis-positioning hunks and
///     corrupting solutions (most visibly `050_no_value`'s
///     duplicated `const Err` + missing closing `}`). All 116
///     Ziglings lessons now verify cleanly under `zig test`.
/// Bumping so returning web visitors re-fetch the manifest and
/// pick up the corrected course bodies.
///
/// V18 — Rustlings runtime fix (no content change, but the
/// in-app web bundle ships a fixed `joinCodeAndTests`). Two
/// regressions surfaced after V17:
///   • `smart-pointers3` was still failing with E0453
///     ("allow(unused_imports) incompatible with previous
///     forbid") because the test-code wrapper carried
///     `#[allow(unused_imports)] use super::*;` — `forbid`
///     overrules `allow`, so the annotation itself errored
///     before the unused-import check ever ran. Fixed by
///     dropping the `#[allow]` outright and making the
///     compile-only test template reference `main` so the
///     import is genuinely used.
///   • The test-wrapper's `indent(testCode, 4)` call was
///     prepending 4 spaces to every line of the test code,
///     including continuation lines INSIDE multi-line string
///     literals — corrupting `hashmaps3`'s `const RESULTS = "…"`
///     so half the team-name keys had leading spaces baked in.
///     Retired `indent()`; Rust doesn't care about indentation,
///     and the per-line space prefix had no upside to weigh
///     against the string-literal corruption.
/// Manifest bumps so returning visitors re-fetch.
///
/// V19 — Golings ingest. New starter course `golings` (43
/// exercises across 13 chapters: variables, functions, if,
/// switch, primitive_types, arrays, slices, maps, range,
/// structs, anonymous_functions, generics, concurrent),
/// ported from mauricioabreu/golings with hand-crafted Go

/// V20 — Exercism Python track ingest. New starter course
/// `exercism-python` (146 lessons across two chapters:
/// Concepts + Practice), mirrored from github.com/exercism/python
/// (MIT-licensed). Each lesson preserves the upstream
/// introduction + instructions + hints; tests are

/// time. Verified 144/146 lessons green in local CPython
/// (remaining 2 are local Python-version artefacts that pass

/// renders the lesson in the dedicated Tracks section between

/// TypeScript / Go / Rust / Elixir / Haskell follow in V21+.
///
/// V21 — Exercism full track expansion. Adds 17 more language

/// translate test code so it runs against Libre's runtime where
/// possible (Python's unittest → kata_test, Jest globals stripped
/// + module paths rewritten for JS/TS, Rust's #[cfg(test)] mod
/// kata_tests wrap with use-statement stripping + #[ignore]
/// removal). Native-runner languages (Ruby, Elixir, Haskell,
/// Scala, Dart, Kotlin, Java, C, C++, C#, Zig, Swift, Lua)
/// ship the upstream tests verbatim — they render in the
/// workbench so learners can read them; `Run` works on desktop
/// builds with the native toolchain installed, and falls back
/// to the desktop-upsell on web. Adds ~2200 new exercises to
/// the catalog in one shot.
///
/// V22 — Track cards swap from the language-icon hero treatment
/// to the dense `CourseCard` layout that books use in grid view
/// (title + author + progress bar + lesson-count meta). Removes
/// the custom `TrackCard` component + its CSS — tracks now look
/// like the same info-dense tiles books do, surfaced consistently
/// across shelf and grid view modes. No content change, just a
/// visual refresh; bump forces returning visitors to pick up the
/// new bundle.
///
/// V23 — Rustlings hints. Every one of the 94 Rustlings exercises
/// now ships ≥2 progressive hints (was: 6 lessons with placeholder
/// "No hints this time" strings, 88 with empty hint arrays). The
/// first hint is a soft concept reminder pulled from the lesson
/// body (or a chapter-keyed Rust-specific pointer when the body
/// doesn't have a per-lesson concept paragraph), and subsequent
/// hints are the upstream rust-lang/rustlings `info.toml` hints
/// split into progressive steps where the original author already

/// V24 — TRPL `rand` API migration. The guessing-game chapter +
/// "External Packages and Nested Paths" lesson taught the `rand`
/// 0.8 surface (`use rand::Rng;` + `rand::thread_rng().gen_range(R)`).
/// The Rust playground ships a recent enough toolchain that the

///
/// V25 — TRPL playground-block wrap. 30 `rust playground` fences
