# Open-Source Book Ingest Tracker

_Living doc tracking which freely-published books are flowing into the Libre catalog, and where each one is in the pipeline._

## 1. Selection criteria

A book makes the list if all of:

- **Freely published online** — CC license, GitHub source, or official-site free read. Paywalled / in-print-only books are out (we'd be retyping them).
- **Modular chapter structure** — chapters can become lessons without surgery.
- **Runnable code, or a clean place to attach a runnable language** — enough that we can derive exercises + drills, not just prose.
- **Won't duplicate the catalog** — adds depth (more JS, deeper Rust) or fills a gap (Lightning, OCaml).

Books that teach a *concept* without owning a single language (algorithms, OS, networking, blockchain protocols) get a `(with X)` suffix. The suffix names the runnable language **or** the popular client-library we anchor the exercise pane to, while the prose stays book-true. Where a domain has a de-facto JS/TS client library, we prefer it — Viem for Ethereum, bitcoinjs-lib for Bitcoin — so the exercise sandbox runs in the existing JS runtime without new compilers to wire up. Examples:

- *Mastering Bitcoin (with bitcoinjs-lib)* — Antonopoulos's prose, runnable TypeScript exercises built on **bitcoinjs-lib** (transaction crafting, script construction, HD wallets, signing) — the de-facto JS Bitcoin library.
- *Mastering Ethereum (with Viem)* — Antonopoulos & Wood's prose, runnable TypeScript exercises built on **Viem** — the modern Ethereum client (RPC, wallet ops, contract reads, ABI encoding).
- *Crafting Interpreters (with JavaScript)* — Nystrom's prose + Lox interpreter, ported to JS so it runs in our browser sandbox.
- *Algorithms — Jeff Erickson (with Python)* — concept-rich pseudocode in the prose, Python in the editor.
- *OSTEP (with C)* — OS concepts; the C code in the book's xv6 / mlfq examples becomes the exercise material.
- *Pro Git* — no suffix; shell + git only, and that's the point.

## 2. Wave 1 — start now

Highest signal-per-page, cleanest fit with the existing pipeline. These four go into ingest in this order; each spawns an agent that drafts a course shell, then runs through the same drill / quiz / cover / sync flow we used for the seed catalog.

| # | Title | License | Language | Source | Est. lessons |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Eloquent JavaScript** (4th ed.) | CC BY-NC 3.0 | JavaScript | [eloquentjavascript.net](https://eloquentjavascript.net) + [GitHub](https://github.com/marijnh/Eloquent-JavaScript) | ~25-30 |
| 2 | **Crafting Interpreters (with JavaScript)** | CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 (text), public-domain code | JavaScript (Lox port) | [craftinginterpreters.com](https://craftinginterpreters.com) + [GitHub](https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters) | ~30-35 |
| 3 | **Programming Bitcoin (with Python)** | MIT (code) | Python | [GitHub](https://github.com/jimmysong/programmingbitcoin) | ~14 |

## 3. Wave 2 — queue after Wave 1 lands

| # | Title | License | Language | Source | Est. lessons |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 5 | **Mastering Bitcoin (with bitcoinjs-lib)** | CC BY-SA 4.0 | TypeScript | [GitHub](https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook) + [bitcoinjs-lib](https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bitcoinjs-lib) | ~12 |
| 6 | **Mastering Ethereum (with Viem)** | CC BY-SA 4.0 | TypeScript | [GitHub](https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook) + [Viem](https://github.com/wevm/viem) | ~14 |

| 8 | **The Modern JavaScript Tutorial** (javascript.info) | CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 | JavaScript | [javascript.info](https://javascript.info) | ~120 (split into 3 sub-courses) |
| 9 | **You Don't Know JS Yet** (2nd ed.) | CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 | JavaScript | [GitHub](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS) | ~30 across 6 short books |
| 10 | **Rust by Example** | Apache-2.0 / MIT | Rust | [GitHub](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-by-example) | ~25 |

## 4. Wave 3 — adds new language coverage

These need runtime work (new compilers / interpreters wired into Libre). Defer until Wave 1+2 land and we have a clearer picture of authoring throughput.

| # | Title | License | Language | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 11 | **The Async Book** (Rust) | Apache-2.0 / MIT | Rust | [GitHub](https://github.com/rust-lang/async-book) | TRPL companion |
| 12 | **The Rustonomicon** | Apache-2.0 / MIT | Rust | [GitHub](https://github.com/rust-lang/nomicon) | Advanced/unsafe Rust |
| 13 | **Composing Programs (with Python)** | CC BY-SA 4.0 | Python | [composingprograms.com](https://composingprograms.com) | UC Berkeley CS61A — Python flavoured SICP |
| 14 | **Open Data Structures (with Python)** | CC BY 2.5 | Python | [opendatastructures.org](https://opendatastructures.org) | Has Java/C++/Python — pick Python |

| 16 | **Functional-Light JavaScript** | CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 | JavaScript | [GitHub](https://github.com/getify/Functional-Light-JS) | FP intro |

## 5. Wave 4 — explicitly deferred

License-friendly and high quality, but each requires a meaningful runtime addition before the exercise pane works. Documented here so we don't lose them.

| Title | Why deferred |
|---|---|
| **Learn You a Haskell** | No Haskell runtime in Libre. |
| **Real World Haskell** | Same. |
| **Real World OCaml (with OCaml)** | No OCaml runtime; could go via js_of_ocaml. |
| **Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces (with C)** | OS concepts; C runs but most exercises rely on a Linux syscall surface we don't have. |
| **xv6 book (with C)** | Same — kernel-level work needs a sandbox. |
| **Beej's Guide to Network Programming (with C)** | Sockets — needs a network sandbox. |

## 7. Per-book ingest workflow

The pipeline used for the seed catalog (TRPL, Svelte 5, Crypto, etc.) — codified for re-use.

1. **Pick course id** — kebab-case slug, e.g. `eloquent-javascript`, `crafting-interpreters-js`, `programming-bitcoin`.
2. **Source format**:
   - GitHub markdown: clone, run a markdown→lesson splitter that respects chapter boundaries.
   - Live docs site: `crawl_docs_site` Tauri command.
   - PDF: `ingest_book` command.
3. **Spawn an authoring agent** with a prompt template (see `scripts/spawn-book-ingest.mjs`, to be created on first run). Agent's job:
   - Read source.
   - Emit a `course.json` matching `data/types.ts`.
   - Generate exercises with `starter` / `solution` / `tests` from the book's code blocks.
4. **Cover art**:
   - Per-book prompts already drafted in `docs/cover-prompts.md` (specimen-plate / armoury preamble).
   - Run via Lovart at 1024 × 1536, save to `cover-overrides/<course-id>.png`.
   - Style guide / palette: `docs/cover-art-style.md`.
5. **Drill authoring** — same agent flow we used for the seed catalog.
6. **Quiz expansion** — same agent flow.
7. **Difficulty tagging** — same agent flow.
8. **Cleanup pass** — same agent flow.
9. **Ship**:
   - Add to `scripts/extract-starter-courses.mjs` PACK_IDS.
   - Add `.libre` archive to `src-tauri/resources/bundled-packs/`.
   - Run `node scripts/extract-starter-courses.mjs && node scripts/sync-drills-to-local.mjs`.
   - Rebuild iOS sim + push.

## 8. Open questions

- **Multi-language books** — *The Modern JavaScript Tutorial* has a node section in book 2 ("server-side JavaScript"); should we tag it `bun` or `javascript`? Default: `javascript`.
- **Crafting Interpreters phasing** — ship as one course (both interpreters back-to-back) or two (`crafting-interpreters-treewalk` + `crafting-interpreters-bytecode`)? The book is ~400 pages each half; one-course feels right since the second half builds on the first.
- **Pro Git mediation** — git is a CLI, not a programming language. Our exercise sandbox can run shell, but `git init` / `git commit` need a writable filesystem context. Plan: ingest as quizzes + readings (fewer exercises) so we don't rebuild the sandbox just for git.
- **Licensing on the cover** — CC BY-NC-ND books restrict derivatives; our drill cards count as derivatives of the prose. Plan: keep drills strictly tied to the book's example code (which is permissively licensed in every Wave-1 entry) and treat prose as "for reading" (untouched).

## 9. Changelog

- **2026-04-28** — Tracker created. Wave 1 selected (Eloquent JS, Crafting Interpreters, Programming Bitcoin, Pro Git). Wave 2-3 queued. All 16 cover prompts drafted in `docs/cover-prompts.md` using the specimen-plate / armoury preamble (Bitcoin + Ethereum prompts ported from earlier chat). PDF version of this tracker generated alongside (`docs/openbook-ingest-tracker.pdf`).
- **2026-04-28** *(later)* — Re-anchored *Mastering Bitcoin* and *Mastering Ethereum* exercise spines to popular JS/TS client libraries: **bitcoinjs-lib** (Bitcoin) and **Viem** (Ethereum), instead of Python / Solidity. Both run in the existing browser sandbox — no new compiler wiring. Convention added to §1: where a domain has a de-facto JS/TS client lib, we prefer it.
- **2026-04-28** *(later still)* — All 15 books in Waves 1–3 have landed and bundled. **15 books · 369 lessons · 201 verified-passing exercises · 485KB compressed.** Sync-latest-courses button shipped (Settings → Data → "Sync now"). Wave 4 (Haskell, OCaml, OS-internals, network-programming) remains explicitly deferred pending new runtime work. Mastering Lightning re-anchored from Python to TypeScript (bolt11 + @noble/secp256k1) for visual + library consistency with Mastering Bitcoin/Ethereum.
