EVERY non-quiz lesson (reading / exercise / mixed) MUST additionally include two top-level enrichment fields:

  "objectives": [ "3 to 5 short bullets (8-14 words each) saying what the learner will KNOW or be able to DO after this lesson" ],
  "enrichment": {
    "glossary": [
      { "term": "closure", "definition": "One-sentence plain-language definition of the term as used in this lesson." }
    ],
    "symbols": [
      {
        "pattern": "Array.prototype.map",
        "signature": "arr.map(callback(item, index?, array?)) -> Array",
        "description": "Creates a new array by applying a function to every element.",
        "docUrl": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map"
      }
    ]
  }

Enrichment rules:
  - `objectives`: 3-5 bullets, imperative / outcome-focused. Start with verbs ("Explain…", "Write…", "Identify…"). No fluff. Skip this field ONLY for pure quiz lessons.
  - `glossary`: every term-of-art the lesson INTRODUCES (not everyday English). Typical lessons have 2-6 entries. Use the term as it first appears in the body so case/spacing matches. Definitions are ONE sentence, ≤ 25 words, no jargon.
  - `symbols`: every identifier that appears inside backticks in the body and maps to a documented stdlib / built-in / language feature (e.g. `Array.prototype.map`, `Vec::new`, `std::io::Read`, `async/await`, `goroutine`, `fmt.Println`). Skip local variable names or user-defined identifiers.
    - `pattern`: the exact backticked string as the body uses it. If the body writes it multiple different ways (e.g. `map` and `Array.prototype.map`), list both as separate entries pointing at the same doc.
    - `docUrl`: canonical official docs. JS/TS → developer.mozilla.org. Rust → doc.rust-lang.org. Go → pkg.go.dev. Python → docs.python.org. Swift → developer.apple.com or swift.org. NEVER make up URLs — omit the field if you don't know a real one.
    - `signature` and `description` are optional but strongly preferred when the symbol has a stable, well-known shape.

CALLOUTS inside `body`:
  Use GitHub-style callout syntax where helpful. Syntax: a blockquote whose FIRST line is `[!TYPE]` with TYPE ∈ {NOTE, WARNING, TIP, EXAMPLE}. E.g.:

    > [!NOTE]
    > Rust's `String` owns its heap buffer, while `&str` is just a borrowed view.

    > [!WARNING]
    > `unwrap()` panics on `None`. Prefer `?` or a match in production code.

  Use them sparingly — 0-2 per lesson. Overuse blunts the effect.

INLINE PLAYGROUND SANDBOXES inside `body`:
  When the prose says "try it" or demonstrates a small self-contained idea, you MAY emit a fenced code block with the info string `<language> playground` to render it as an inline runnable editor in the reader. Example:

    ```javascript playground
    const xs = [1, 2, 3];
    console.log(xs.map(x => x * 2));
    ```

  Rules:
    - Snippet must be ≤ 10 lines and self-contained (no test harness, no module.exports, no imports of user code).
    - Use sparingly — 0-2 per lesson.
    - Only for the lesson's primary language.

READING:
  { "id": "...", "kind": "reading", "title": "...", "body": "markdown with fenced code blocks", "objectives": [...], "enrichment": { ... } }

EXERCISE (single-file, the default):
  {
    "id": "...", "kind": "exercise", "title": "...",
    "language": "...",
    "body": "markdown prompt explaining the task",
    "starter": "runnable file ending with module.exports = { ... } (JS) or equivalent",
    "solution": "reference solution — must pass every test",
    "tests": "test file using the harness below"
  }

EXERCISE (multi-file, when the task genuinely benefits from multiple files):
  {
    "id": "...", "kind": "exercise", "title": "...",
    "language": "...",
    "body": "markdown prompt",
    "files": [
      { "name": "index.html", "language": "html", "content": "..." },
      { "name": "style.css",  "language": "css",  "content": "..." },
      { "name": "user.js",    "language": "javascript", "content": "..." }
    ],
    "solutionFiles": [ /* same shape as files */ ],
    "starter": "<concatenation of runnable files — kept for legacy single-file runners>",
    "solution": "<concatenation of runnable files in solutionFiles>",
    "tests": "test file (still a single string)"
  }

QUIZ:
  {
    "id": "...", "kind": "quiz", "title": "...",
    "body": "optional short intro (may be empty)",
    "questions": [
      { "kind": "mcq", "prompt": "...", "options": ["a","b","c","d"], "correctIndex": 0, "explanation": "..." },
      { "kind": "short", "prompt": "...", "accept": ["answer-1","alt"], "explanation": "..." }
    ]
  }

When to use multi-file EXERCISE (STRONG RULES — do not shortcut):
  - Rust lessons that teach modules, crates, workspaces, or file organization (e.g. Chapter 7 of the Rust Book — "Packages, Crates, and Modules") MUST ship as multi-file. Do NOT cram `mod foo { ... }` blocks into a single file to simulate multi-file layout — the whole point of the lesson is the filesystem layout.
  - Rust integration-test lessons MUST ship as multi-file with `src/lib.rs` + `tests/integration_test.rs` (and optionally `tests/common/mod.rs`). Integration tests only work in the `tests/` directory — a single-file exercise cannot teach them correctly.
  - Rust Chapter 12-style CLI projects (minigrep) that split logic across `src/main.rs` + `src/lib.rs` MUST ship multi-file once the book has demonstrated the split.
  - Web/UI tasks needing HTML + CSS + JS MUST ship multi-file (`index.html`, `style.css`, `user.js`).
  - Tasks where the book's example is itself shown as multiple files SHOULD mirror that layout.
  - Otherwise default to single-file. Don't split just because you can.

File naming + language:
  - "language" per file: "javascript", "typescript", "python", "rust", "swift", "html", "css", "json", "plaintext"
  - For Rust: use real paths like "src/lib.rs", "src/main.rs", "src/front_of_house.rs", "src/front_of_house/hosting.rs", "tests/integration_test.rs", "Cargo.toml" (Cargo.toml uses language "plaintext")
  - For web: "index.html", "style.css", "user.js"
  - The runnable files must match the lesson's primary `language`. CSS/HTML in a JS lesson are visual support, not executable.
  - `starter` and `solution` (the legacy flat strings) must still be populated. For multi-file, concatenate the runnable files' contents with "// ---- <name> ----\n" separators (or the language's equivalent comment syntax) so legacy single-file runners still work.

TEST HARNESS — pick per `language`:

  If language == "javascript" or "typescript":
    test(name, fn)
    expect(x).toBe(y)
    expect(x).toEqual(y)
    expect(x).toBeTruthy() / toBeFalsy()
    expect(x).toBeGreaterThan(n) / toBeLessThan(n)
    expect(x).toContain(item)
    expect(x).toBeCloseTo(v, digits)
    expect(fn).toThrow()
    require('./user')   // returns the user's module.exports
    Starter + solution MUST end with `module.exports = { ... }`.

  If language == "python":
    test("name of test", lambda: ...) or
    def test_name():
      expect(x).to_be(y)
      expect(x).to_equal(y)
      expect(x).to_be_truthy() / to_be_falsy()
    User code is exposed as the `user` module; import with `from user import X`.

  If language == "rust":
    Standard Rust test syntax — NOT a JavaScript-style harness. Use:
      #[test]
      fn test_xyz() {
          assert_eq!(add(2, 3), 5);
          assert!(condition);
          assert_ne!(a, b);
      }
    Tests are wrapped automatically in `#[cfg(test)] mod tests { use super::*; ... }` by the runtime; emit raw `#[test] fn ... { ... }` functions in the `tests` field, NOT a module declaration.
    For multi-file Rust with integration tests, put the `#[test]` functions directly in `tests/integration_test.rs` as a standalone file and leave `tests` (the legacy string) empty — integration tests live outside src/.
    NEVER write `test("name", || { ... })` or `expect(x).to_be(y)` in Rust — those are JavaScript idioms and will not compile.

  If language == "swift":
    The Swift runtime is run-only (no automated grading in V1). Leave `tests` as an empty string "".

Writing guidelines:
  - Rewrite tight in Fishbones voice — friendly, terse, no filler. Do not quote long passages from the source verbatim.
  - Use `backticks` for identifiers and ```lang fences for code in lesson bodies.
  - Exercise starters MUST be runnable (no TODO syntax that errors on load) — use comments for TODOs. For Rust exercises, `fn main() { ... }` should compile even with the user's function stubbed to `todo!()`.
  - Quizzes: 3–5 questions, mix of mcq (4 options, one correct) and short-answer. `accept` is a list of equally-valid answers (case/punctuation-insensitive match).

    "tests": "language-appropriate test code (see TEST HARNESS rules below)",

  {
    "title": "...",
    "body": "...",
    "files": [ { "name": "...", "language": "...", "content": "..." }, ... ],
    "solutionFiles": [ ... ],
    "starter": "<concat of files — legacy fallback>",
    "solution": "<concat of solutionFiles — legacy fallback>",
    "tests": "...",
    "hints": [ ... ]
  }

DIFFICULTY GUIDE:
  easy   — one concept, ~5-10 lines of solution, obvious approach.
  medium — two concepts composed (e.g. iterators + structs), 10-25 lines, one non-obvious step.
  hard   — algorithmic or subtle edge cases, 25-60 lines, multiple concepts interacting.

TOPIC: focus the problem around the given topic. If the topic is "iterators", every test should exercise iterator behavior; don't drift into unrelated concepts.

TEST HARNESS — STRONG RULES (non-negotiable):
  - Every test MUST contain at least one real assertion that exercises learner code with a specific input and checks a specific output/state.
  - BANNED patterns:
      * Tests that just call the function and assert nothing ("trust the structure" — always passes).
      * Tests that only check the function's type signature or existence ("does it compile" — always passes once parsed).
      * For binary-crate outputs where stdout-capture is impractical (Rust main printing), REFORMULATE the challenge so the learner writes a function that RETURNS the value, and `main` just prints it. The tests then `assert_eq!` on the function's return — never on stdout.
  - Provide ≥ 3 assertions covering: the normal case, an edge case (empty / zero / boundary), and an error / unusual case.

  Rust:
    Use standard Rust test syntax:
      #[test]
      fn test_reverse_basic() {
          assert_eq!(reverse("hello"), "olleh");
      }
    The runtime wraps your `#[test]` functions in `#[cfg(test)] mod tests { use super::*; ... }` automatically. Emit raw `#[test] fn ... { ... }` functions.
    NEVER use JavaScript idioms (`test("name", || { ... })`, `expect(x).to_be(y)`) in Rust.
    If the task requires printing to stdout, REFORMULATE: make the learner implement a function that RETURNS the string, and have `main` (in `starter`/`solution`) just `println!("{}", user_fn())`. Tests assert on the return value.

  TypeScript / JavaScript:
    Use the Fishbones harness:
      test("description", () => { ... })
      expect(x).toBe(y)
      expect(x).toEqual(y)
      expect(fn).toThrow()
    Starter + solution MUST end with `module.exports = { ... }` listing every exported symbol. Tests import via `require('./user')`.

  Go:
    The runtime uses a structured-stdout protocol (NOT `go test`, since the Playground can't run it from a single source).
    Your `tests` field MUST be a complete Go source with `func main()` that:
      1. Defines helper functions named `kataTest_<name>() error` — each runs one assertion and returns `nil` on pass, a non-nil `error` (wrap with `fmt.Errorf`) on fail.
      2. From `main()`, iterates over them and prints EXACTLY:
           `KATA_TEST::<name>::PASS` on success
           `KATA_TEST::<name>::FAIL::<short one-line reason>` on failure
    Do NOT import "testing" or use `*testing.T` — the Playground isn't running `go test`.
    Starter + solution are helper functions only (no `func main()`); the test file provides main.
    Example main:
      func main() {
          tests := []struct{ name string; fn func() error }{
              {"test_reverse_basic", kataTest_test_reverse_basic},
              {"test_reverse_empty", kataTest_test_reverse_empty},
          }
          for _, t := range tests {
              if err := t.fn(); err != nil {
                  fmt.Printf("KATA_TEST::%s::FAIL::%s\n", t.name, err.Error())
              } else {
                  fmt.Printf("KATA_TEST::%s::PASS\n", t.name)
              }
          }
      }

  Python:
    Use the Fishbones harness: `def test_name(): expect(x).to_be(y)`.
    User code is exposed as `user` module; tests do `from user import thing`.

  Swift:
    Run-only (no automated grading). Set `tests` to "".

WRITING GUIDELINES:
  - Title: concrete verb phrase ("Reverse a String", "Count Unique Words", "Implement LRU Cache").
  - Body: lead with what to build, THEN input/output examples, THEN constraints. Use ```lang code fences for snippets. Keep it tight — kata problems are ≤ 150 words of prose.
  - Starter: the function signature + a `TODO: ...` comment in the body. MUST compile. For Rust stubs, use `todo!()`. For TS/Go, return a trivial default.
  - Solution: must pass every test you wrote. Don't write a test you can't satisfy.
  - Hints: 1-3 short progressive nudges. Optional — omit the field if no natural hints.

Return ONLY the JSON object. Begin with `{`, end with `}`. No markdown fences, no preamble."#;
