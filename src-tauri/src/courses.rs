//! Course loading + import/export.
//!
//! At rest, a course is a folder in `<app_data_dir>/courses/<course-id>/` with
//! a `course.json` at its root:
//!
//! ```json
//! { "id": "rust-book", "title": "...", "language": "rust",
//!   "chapters": [ { "id":"...", "title":"...", "lessons":[ ... ] } ] }
//! ```
//!
//! Lessons are inlined in the JSON for V1 (no separate .md files yet). A
//! future step will split prose out into sibling .md files.
//!
//! Share/export uses a `.fishbones` archive — a zip of the course folder.
//! Legacy `.kata` archives are still accepted on import for backwards compat.
//! Import unpacks the archive into `<app_data_dir>/courses/<course-id>/`.

///       to ship 18 newly-imported books (Eloquent JS, Rust Book,

///   3 — Library retirement. Drops four books that shipped in earlier
///       bundles but were retired (`bun-complete`, `bun-fundamentals`,
///       `svelte-5-complete`, `javascript-crash-course`). Existing
