// The runtime now dispatches to `zig test` (not `zig run`), so each
// exercise's `tests` field is just a header import + native
// `test "name" {}` blocks. No custom main(), no runTest helper, no
// KATA_TEST stdout protocol. `buildTests` (below) translates the
// existing `testFns` + `runs` shape into the new form on the fly so
// the per-exercise definitions don't have to be rewritten.
//
// Why native: see `src-tauri/src/native_runners.rs::run_zig` —
// idiomatic Zig, free leak detection via `std.testing.allocator`,
// stable output format across Zig releases.

/// surfaces in the test list, `fn` is the test function name.
///
/// IMPORTANT: testFns gets sanitised before being inlined:
///   - `const std = @import("std");` lines are stripped. Many starter
///     files for Zig exercises already declare `std` at the top, and
///     when the runtime concatenates `code + tests`, two competing
///     `const std = @import("std");` declarations collide with
///     `error: duplicate struct member name 'std'`.

///     binding to the alias the harness header imports. This way the

        "Describe Zig's place among modern systems languages",
        "Recognise the three pillars: simplicity, comptime, manual memory",
        "Explain why Zig has no garbage collector",
        "Decide whether Zig is the right tool for your project",
      ],
      body: `**Zig** is a small, strongly-typed compiled language designed as a modern alternative to C. It compiles to native machine code, has no runtime, no garbage collector, and no hidden control flow. If a function looks innocent, it _is_ innocent — there are no implicit allocations, exceptions, or virtual dispatches lurking inside.

The language sits in roughly the same niche as C, C++, and Rust. Compared to those:

| Feature | C | C++ | Rust | Zig |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Manual memory | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ (with borrow checker) | ✓ (with allocators) |
| No GC | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Generics | ✗ | templates | traits + monomorphisation | comptime |
| Compile-time eval | macros | constexpr | const fn | first-class \`comptime\` |
| Error handling | int returns | exceptions | \`Result<T, E>\` | error unions \`!T\` |
| Build system | Make / CMake | Make / CMake | Cargo | \`zig build\` |

Three pillars run through every design decision:

1. **No hidden control flow.** No operator overloading that can throw, no implicit coercions, no destructors that run when you didn't ask. What you read is what you run.
2. **Comptime over macros.** Anything you'd reach for a macro for in C — generics, conditional compilation, code generation — is plain Zig code that runs at compile time. The compiler is your build script.
3. **Allocators are arguments.** A function that needs heap memory takes an \`Allocator\` parameter. The caller picks the strategy: a general-purpose pool, an arena that frees in bulk, a fixed buffer, or your own implementation.

**When to choose Zig.** It shines for systems work that needs C interop and tight control over allocations: embedded firmware, game engines, kernel modules, hot paths inside larger programs. The standard library is small but well-curated. The language is still pre-1.0 — expect occasional churn — but the core has stabilised enough for production deployments at companies like Bun.sh and TigerBeetle.

This course assumes you can read C-family code (functions, conditions, loops, structs) but doesn't assume any prior systems-programming background. By the end you'll be comfortable with manual memory, comptime generics, error unions, and Zig's standard library idioms.`,

## macOS

\`\`\`bash
# Homebrew (easiest)
brew install zig

# Or extract the official tarball:
curl -LO https://ziglang.org/download/0.16.0/zig-macos-aarch64-0.16.0.tar.xz
tar -xf zig-macos-aarch64-0.16.0.tar.xz
sudo mv zig-macos-aarch64-0.16.0 /usr/local/zig
echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/zig:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
\`\`\`

## Linux

\`\`\`bash
curl -LO https://ziglang.org/download/0.16.0/zig-linux-x86_64-0.16.0.tar.xz
tar -xf zig-linux-x86_64-0.16.0.tar.xz
sudo mv zig-linux-x86_64-0.16.0 /usr/local/zig
echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/zig:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
\`\`\`

Distribution package managers (\`apt\`, \`pacman\`, \`dnf\`) often ship Zig but tend to lag behind. The official tarball gives you the latest tagged release.

## Windows

Download \`zig-windows-x86_64-0.16.0.zip\`, extract it, and add the folder to your \`PATH\` via *System Properties → Environment Variables*. Or use \`scoop install zig\`.

## Verify

In a fresh terminal:

\`\`\`bash
zig version
\`\`\`

You should see something like \`0.16.0\`. **This course targets Zig 0.16+** — that's the line carrying the I/O overhaul (\`std.fs.File.stdout()\` instead of \`std.io.getStdOut()\`) and the unmanaged \`ArrayList\` defaults that the lessons rely on. If \`zig\` isn't found, your \`PATH\` change probably hasn't reached the current shell; open a new terminal.

> [!WARNING]
> Older Zig versions (0.13 and earlier) used a noticeably different stdio API and a managed \`ArrayList\` that stored its allocator. The Libre runtime ships test harnesses written for the 0.16 form. Upgrade if you're stuck on an older toolchain — \`brew upgrade zig\` or grab the latest tarball.

> [!TIP]
> The Libre desktop app shells out to the \`zig\` on your \`PATH\` every time you press *Run*. If \`zig version\` works in your terminal, the editor will find it too.

## What you got

Unlike C, Zig is a single binary. \`zig\` is the compiler, the test runner, the formatter (\`zig fmt\`), the build system (\`zig build\`), the package manager, and even a [drop-in C/C++ compiler](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#Zig-As-A-Library) (\`zig cc\`, \`zig c++\`). One tool, no Makefiles, no extra dependencies.`,

        "Distinguish builtins (`@something`) from library functions",
        "Understand `pub` visibility",
      ],
      body: `## \`@import\`

Zig has no \`#include\` and no module keyword. You bring code in with \`@import\`:

\`\`\`zig
const std = @import("std");
const calc = @import("calc.zig"); // a sibling file
\`\`\`

\`@import("std")\` gives you the standard library. Anything else is a path relative to the file doing the import. The result of \`@import\` is a struct — to access its members you write \`std.mem.eql\`, not \`std::mem::eql\` (Rust) or \`std.mem.Eql\` (Go).

## Builtins

Identifiers starting with \`@\` are **compiler builtins**, not library functions:

\`\`\`zig
const T = @TypeOf(value); // type introspection
const x: i64 = @intCast(small_value); // explicit conversion
const ptr = @ptrCast(*Foo, raw); // pointer reinterpret
@panic("unreachable");
\`\`\`

Builtins are the compiler's escape hatch for things that can't be expressed as ordinary functions: type-level operations, casts that affect representation, special instructions. The full list lives in the [language reference](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#Builtin-Functions).

## \`pub\` visibility

Declarations are private to their file by default. The \`pub\` modifier exposes them across files:

\`\`\`zig
pub fn greeting() []const u8 { return "hi"; } // visible to other files
fn helper() void {}                            // file-private
\`\`\`

This applies to functions, constants, types — everything declared at the top level.

## No forward declarations

Order doesn't matter. Functions can call each other in any order; types can refer to each other freely. The compiler reads the whole file before it starts validating references.

## A first runnable program

Here's the smallest program that does something visible:

\`\`\`zig
const std = @import("std");

pub fn main() !void {
    std.debug.print("Hello from main!\\n", .{});
}
\`\`\`

A few things to notice:
- The \`!\` in \`!void\` says \`main\` may return an error. This is needed because \`std.debug.print\` itself can fail (its output stream might be unavailable).
- \`.{}\` is an **anonymous struct literal** — it's how you pass formatting arguments. Even when there are none, you still pass an empty \`.{}\`.
- The \`\\n\` is a newline; \`std.debug.print\` does not add one for you.`,

      objectives: [
        "Choose between `const` and `var` correctly",

\`\`\`zig
const pi = 3.14159; // immutable — pi can never be reassigned
var counter: u32 = 0; // mutable — can be reassigned
counter += 1;
\`\`\`

\`const\` is the default you reach for. Reach for \`var\` only when you actually need to reassign. The compiler enforces this — try mutating a \`const\` and you'll get \`error: cannot assign to constant\`.

## Type inference

Zig infers types from the initialiser, but you can — and sometimes must — annotate explicitly:

\`\`\`zig
const a = 42;          // a : comptime_int (more on this in chapter 10)
const b: u32 = 42;     // b : u32
var c: i64 = -1;       // c : i64

const d: []const u8 = "hi"; // string literal → annotated as a slice
\`\`\`

When inference would pick a too-flexible type (\`comptime_int\`, \`comptime_float\`), and the value is later used as a runtime variable, you'll usually want to pin the type explicitly.

## Why \`const\` matters

Zig optimises aggressively around immutability. A \`const\` declaration:
- Can be folded into the binary if its value is known at compile time.
- Is safe to share between threads (no data race possible — nothing can mutate it).
- Makes the function easier to read: a glance at \`const\` tells the reader "this won't change".

The conventional wisdom is **prefer \`const\` until you're forced to use \`var\`**. If you find yourself writing \`var\` and never reassigning, change it to \`const\` — the compiler doesn't warn but other Zig developers notice.

## Unused variables are errors

Zig refuses to compile if you declare a variable and don't read it:

\`\`\`zig
fn foo() void {
    const x = 42; // error: unused local constant
}
\`\`\`

If you genuinely need to discard a value (a function returns something you don't care about), assign to \`_\`:

\`\`\`zig
fn foo() void {
    _ = somethingThatReturnsAValue();
}
\`\`\`

This is annoying for two days, then becomes a feature you miss in other languages. Dead code never accumulates.`,

      ],
      body: `## Integers

Zig's integer types are explicit about width and signedness:

| Family | Sizes | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Unsigned | \`u8\` \`u16\` \`u32\` \`u64\` \`u128\` | 0 to 2ⁿ-1 |
| Signed | \`i8\` \`i16\` \`i32\` \`i64\` \`i128\` | -2ⁿ⁻¹ to 2ⁿ⁻¹-1 |
| Pointer-sized | \`usize\` \`isize\` | Width matches the pointer width — 64-bit on most modern hardware |
| **Arbitrary width** | \`u1\` \`u3\` \`u47\` \`i12\` … | Any bit count, signed or unsigned |

Arbitrary-width integers are unusual. \`u47\` is a real type — useful when packing structures or modelling hardware registers where a field really is 47 bits wide.

\`\`\`zig
const flags: u3 = 0b101; // 3-bit value, 0..7
const port: u16 = 8080;
const i: usize = 0;      // typical loop / index variable
\`\`\`

## Floats

\`\`\`zig
const a: f32 = 3.14;
const b: f64 = 6.022e23;
const c: f128 = 1.0;     // 128-bit IEEE quad-precision
\`\`\`

Other widths exist (\`f16\`, \`f80\`) for specialised contexts; \`f32\` and \`f64\` cover the common cases.

## Conversions are explicit

This is one of the bigger differences from C. Zig refuses implicit narrowing:

\`\`\`zig
const big: i64 = 1_000;
const small: i32 = big; // compile error: cannot cast i64 to i32 implicitly

const small: i32 = @intCast(big); // explicit narrowing
\`\`\`

Underscores are valid digit separators (\`1_000_000\`) — useful for readable constants.

## \`comptime_int\` and \`comptime_float\`

Numeric literals start out as \`comptime_int\` or \`comptime_float\` — types that exist only at compile time and have unlimited precision. They coerce to any concrete numeric type that can hold them:

\`\`\`zig
const x: u8 = 100;       // 100 is comptime_int → coerces fine
const y: u8 = 1_000_000; // compile error: doesn't fit in u8
\`\`\`

For \`var\` declarations, the inferred type would be the unbounded comptime type — so you need an explicit annotation:

\`\`\`zig
var i = 0;       // error: variable of type 'comptime_int' must be const
var i: usize = 0; // fine
\`\`\`

## Overflow is a checked error

In debug builds, integer overflow traps:

\`\`\`zig
var x: u8 = 250;
x += 10; // panic: integer overflow
\`\`\`

In release-fast builds, overflow is undefined behaviour. If you genuinely want wrap-around arithmetic, use the explicit operators \`+%\`, \`-%\`, \`*%\`, or the \`@addWithOverflow\` family of builtins. This trade-off — safety in debug, speed in release — is a recurring theme.`,

\`\`\`zig
const open: bool = true;
const closed: bool = false;
\`\`\`

\`bool\` is a real type — there's no implicit conversion from integers. \`if (1) {}\` is a compile error; \`if (x != 0) {}\` works.

## Logical operators

Zig uses **keywords**, not symbols:

\`\`\`zig
if (logged_in and !banned) { /* ... */ }
if (admin or moderator) { /* ... */ }
const safe = !dangerous;
\`\`\`

\`and\` and \`or\` short-circuit just like \`&&\` and \`||\` in C — the right side is only evaluated if needed.

## Comparison

\`==\` \`!=\` \`<\` \`>\` \`<=\` \`>=\` — all standard, all return \`bool\`.

But there's one trap: \`==\` does **not** work on slices or strings. The following is a compile error:

\`\`\`zig
const a: []const u8 = "GET";
const b: []const u8 = "GET";
if (a == b) {} // error: operator == not allowed for type []const u8
\`\`\`

Use \`std.mem.eql\`:

\`\`\`zig
const std = @import("std");
if (std.mem.eql(u8, a, b)) { /* a and b have identical contents */ }
\`\`\`

For case-insensitive ASCII comparison, \`std.ascii.eqlIgnoreCase\`.

## No truthiness

Optional types must be unwrapped (\`if (x) |v|\` — chapter 7). Error unions must be handled (\`try\`, \`catch\`). There's no implicit "is this thing falsy?" — every conditional expression must have type \`bool\`. This eliminates a whole category of bugs at the cost of a little verbosity.`,

Zig switches are **expressions** — like \`if\`, they produce a value. They're also **exhaustive**: every possible value of the switched-on type must be covered. With a finite enum the compiler can check that mechanically; with an integer you'll usually need an \`else =>\` arm.

## Multiple values and ranges

\`\`\`zig
fn arrivalTime(minutes: u16) []const u8 {
    return switch (minutes) {
        0 => "arrived",

\`\`\`

Notice:
- Comma-separated values (\`1, 2\`) match either.
- \`3...5\` is an **inclusive** range (3, 4, AND 5). This is _different_ from \`for (3..5)\` ranges, which are exclusive on the right.

## Switching on enums

When you switch on an enum and exhaust every variant, you can omit the \`else =>\` and the compiler will keep you honest if you ever add a new variant — adding a case becomes a compile error you can't ignore. This is a major reason Zig code uses enums liberally.

## Switching on tagged unions

Tagged unions (chapter 6) get a special form where the case captures the active payload:

\`\`\`zig
switch (timestamp) {
    .unix => |ts| std.debug.print("epoch {d}\\n", .{ts}),
    .iso8601 => |s| std.debug.print("string {s}\\n", .{s}),

\`\`\`zig
var i: usize = 0;
while (i < 10) {
    std.debug.print("{d}\\n", .{i});
    i += 1;
}
\`\`\`

The condition runs before each iteration, just like C. There's a useful extension — a "post-statement" runs after each body:

\`\`\`zig
var i: usize = 0;
while (i < 10) : (i += 1) {
    std.debug.print("{d}\\n", .{i});
}
\`\`\`

Reads more like a \`for\` loop in other languages, with the increment cleanly separated.

## while-else

A while loop can have an \`else\` block that runs when the condition becomes false (and you _didn't_ \`break\`):

\`\`\`zig
const found = while (it.next()) |x| {
    if (x == target) break true;
} else false;
\`\`\`

Combined with \`break\` returning a value (chapter 3.7), this gives you a remarkably compact "search and report" idiom.

## for over a slice

\`\`\`zig
const numbers = [_]i32{ 1, 2, 3, 4 };
for (numbers) |n| {
    std.debug.print("{d}\\n", .{n});
}
\`\`\`

The \`|n|\` is a **capture** — it binds the loop variable. Reads as "for each \`n\` in numbers".

## for over a range

\`\`\`zig
for (0..10) |i| {
    // i is 0, 1, 2, ..., 9
}
\`\`\`

Range \`0..10\` is **exclusive** on the right (10 is not visited). Mind the difference from \`switch\` ranges (\`0...10\` — three dots, inclusive). The two-dot vs three-dot distinction is intentional but easy to mix up.

## Parallel iteration

\`\`\`zig
for (left, right) |a, b| {
    std.debug.print("{d} {d}\\n", .{ a, b });
}
\`\`\`

All sequences must be the same length — the compiler checks at runtime in debug builds. To loop over a sequence with its index, use \`0..\`:

\`\`\`zig
for (slice, 0..) |value, i| {
    if (value == target) return i;
}
\`\`\`

The \`0..\` infers its endpoint from the sibling sequence's length.`,

    if (x < 0) continue;
    if (x > 100) break;
    std.debug.print("{d}\\n", .{x});
}
\`\`\`

These act on the innermost loop, like in C.

## Labelled loops

Prefix any loop with a label and \`continue :label\` / \`break :label\` to target it:

\`\`\`zig
outer: for (rows) |row| {
    for (row) |cell| {
        if (cell == 0) continue :outer; // skip to the next row
    }
}
\`\`\`

Label names are followed by a colon at the definition site (\`outer:\`) and prefixed with a colon at the jump site (\`:outer\`). Same syntax for \`break :outer\`.

## Blocks as expressions

A labelled block can return a value via \`break :label value\`:

\`\`\`zig
const verdict = blk: {
    if (errors > 100) break :blk "fail";
    if (warnings > 0) break :blk "warn";
    break :blk "ok";
};
\`\`\`

Reads a bit like a Rust \`'label: { … }\` block. Useful when you want to compute a value with several conditional paths and bind it to a single \`const\`.

## while-with-break-value

Combined with \`while\`, \`break value\` lets you write search-and-report loops as expressions:

\`\`\`zig
const found_index = blk: {
    var i: usize = 0;
    while (i < xs.len) : (i += 1) {
        if (xs[i] == needle) break :blk i;
    }
    break :blk null;
};
\`\`\`

\`break\` carries the value out of the labelled block; \`found_index\` ends up being either a \`usize\` index or \`null\`.`,

}
\`\`\`

Parameters list their type after a colon. Return type comes _after_ the parameter list (no \`->\` arrow). Use \`void\` when there's nothing to return.

## Parameters are immutable

You **cannot** reassign a parameter inside the function body:

\`\`\`zig
fn double(x: i32) i32 {
    x = x * 2; // compile error: cannot assign to constant
    return x;
}
\`\`\`

If you need a mutable copy, declare a local:

\`\`\`zig
fn double(x: i32) i32 {
    var y = x;
    y *= 2;
    return y;
}
\`\`\`

This trades a tiny convenience for a strong guarantee: a parameter you pass to a function won't be changed under you.

## No overloading

Each function name in a file refers to exactly one function. There's no overloading by argument types — if you want behaviour that varies by type, use \`anytype\` or a generic function (chapter 10).

## No forward declarations

Functions can call each other in any order. Define them top-down, bottom-up, alphabetically — whatever you prefer:

\`\`\`zig
fn outer() i32 { return helper() + 1; }
fn helper() i32 { return 41; }
\`\`\`

## \`pub\` and visibility

Top-level functions are file-private by default. \`pub fn\` exposes them to other files via \`@import\`.

## \`noreturn\`

A function that never returns (panics, infinite loop, calls \`std.process.exit\`) can declare its return type as \`noreturn\`:

\`\`\`zig
fn fatal(msg: []const u8) noreturn {
    std.debug.print("{s}\\n", .{msg});
    std.process.exit(1);
}
\`\`\`

The compiler uses this for control-flow analysis — code after a \`noreturn\` call is unreachable.`,

    var lo: i32 = xs[0];
    var hi: i32 = xs[0];

std.debug.print("range: {d}..{d}\\n", .{ s.min, s.max });
\`\`\`

The \`.{ ... }\` syntax in the \`return\` statement is an **anonymous struct literal** — Zig figures out which struct type it should be from context.

## Use an out-parameter

\`\`\`zig

The \`.*\` operator dereferences a pointer (covered properly in chapter 8). Out-parameters are useful when:
- The callsite already has variables to write into.
- You want to skip computing one of the outputs.
- You're targeting a tight loop and want to avoid even the cheap struct copy.

For most code, **return a struct**. It's clearer, and the optimiser usually elides the copy.`,

There's no special tail-call elimination guarantee. If you write a function that recurses thousands of levels deep, you'll **stack overflow** — the OS hands each thread a finite stack (typically 8 MB on Linux/macOS, 1 MB on Windows) and Zig's runtime won't grow it for you.

## When recursion is fine

- The depth is bounded and small (parsing trees, simple combinatorics, divide-and-conquer up to ~log n).
- Each stack frame is small (a few local variables, no big arrays).

## When to switch to iteration

- Depth is unbounded or learner-controlled (input-driven).
- The recursion is "linear" — each call makes one recursive call (so an iterative loop trivially substitutes).

  title: "Arrays, Slices, and Strings",
  lessons: [
    reading({
      id: "arrays",
      title: "Arrays — fixed size at compile time",
      objectives: [
        "Declare an array with `[N]T`",
        "Recognise that array length is part of the type",
        "Initialise with literals and `[_]T{ ... }` length-inference",
      ],
      body: `## Declaring arrays

\`\`\`zig
const numbers: [4]i32 = .{ 1, 2, 3, 4 };
const greetings: [3][]const u8 = .{ "hi", "hey", "yo" };
\`\`\`

The number inside the brackets is the **length, baked into the type**. \`[4]i32\` and \`[5]i32\` are different types and don't interoperate without an explicit conversion. This is unusual coming from C (where arrays decay to pointers) or higher-level languages (where length is just data).

## Length inference

Writing the length manually is annoying and error-prone, so Zig has \`[_]T\`:

\`\`\`zig
const numbers = [_]i32{ 1, 2, 3, 4 };
const fruits = [_][]const u8{ "apple", "pear", "fig" };
\`\`\`

The \`_\` says "compute the length from the literal". The actual type after compilation is still \`[4]i32\` / \`[3][]const u8\`.

## Indexing and len

\`\`\`zig
const numbers = [_]i32{ 10, 20, 30 };
const second = numbers[1]; // 20
const count: usize = numbers.len; // 3 — comptime-known
\`\`\`

Out-of-bounds access **panics in debug** and is undefined in release-fast.

## Multi-dimensional arrays

\`\`\`zig
const grid = [3][3]u8{
    .{ 1, 2, 3 },
    .{ 4, 5, 6 },
    .{ 7, 8, 9 },
};
const middle = grid[1][1]; // 5
\`\`\`

The type reads outside-in: "array of 3 [arrays of 3 u8]".

## Why not just use slices?

Arrays are zero-overhead — the length is a compile-time fact, not a runtime field. They're useful when:
- The size is fixed and small (a 16-byte hash, a 4-element vector).
- You're working in stack memory and want to avoid allocation.
- You're modelling hardware (registers, packed bytes).

When the size is dynamic or unknown, you need a **slice**.`,
      glossary: [
        {
          term: "fixed-size array",
          definition:
            "An array `[N]T` whose length is part of the type. Stored inline, no heap, length is comptime-known.",
        },
      ],
    }),

    reading({
      id: "slices",
      title: "Slices — pointer + length",
      objectives: [
        "Recognise the slice type `[]T` (and `[]const T`)",
        "Take a slice of an array with `arr[..]` or `arr[a..b]`",
        "Use `slice.len` and `slice.ptr`",
      ],
      body: `A **slice** is a pointer paired with a length. Written \`[]T\` (mutable) or \`[]const T\` (immutable), it lets you pass around a view into a contiguous run of \`T\`s without committing to a fixed length at compile time.

\`\`\`zig
const arr = [_]i32{ 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 };
const all: []const i32 = &arr;            // full slice
const middle: []const i32 = arr[1..4];     // [20, 30, 40]
const tail: []const i32 = arr[2..];        // [30, 40, 50]
\`\`\`

Internally a slice is two fields:

\`\`\`zig
struct {
    ptr: [*]T,    // many-item pointer
    len: usize,   // element count
}
\`\`\`

You access them with \`.ptr\` and \`.len\`.

## Slicing syntax

\`\`\`zig
arr[a..b]      // exclusive: arr[a], arr[a+1], ..., arr[b-1]
arr[a..]       // from a to the end
arr[..b]       // from the start to b-1
arr[..]        // the whole thing
\`\`\`

Slicing is **bounds-checked at runtime in debug**. \`arr[10..20]\` on a 5-element array panics.

## Slices vs arrays

- **Array** \`[N]T\`: length is part of the type, known at compile time. Stored inline. A function declared \`fn f(a: [4]i32)\` only accepts 4-element arrays.
- **Slice** \`[]T\`: pointer + runtime length. Stored as two words pointing elsewhere. \`fn f(a: []const i32)\` accepts any length.

The vast majority of functions take slices, not arrays. If you write \`fn sum(xs: [4]i32)\` you can only call it with arrays of length 4 — switch to \`fn sum(xs: []const i32)\` and any slice (or array reference) works.

## Mutability

\`\`\`zig
var arr = [_]i32{ 1, 2, 3 };
const view: []i32 = &arr;        // mutable slice — can write through
const readonly: []const i32 = &arr; // can read, can't write
view[0] = 99;                     // ok
readonly[0] = 99;                 // compile error
\`\`\`

The \`const\` in \`[]const T\` applies to the elements, not the slice itself.`,
      glossary: [G.slice],
    }),

    reading({
      id: "strings",
      title: "Strings are slices of bytes",
      objectives: [
        "Recognise `[]const u8` as the conventional string type",
        "Use string literals and their null-terminated arrays",
        "Compare strings with `std.mem.eql`",
      ],
      body: `Zig has no dedicated string type. **A string is a slice of bytes**, conventionally \`[]const u8\`.

## String literals

\`\`\`zig
const s = "Hello";
\`\`\`

The literal's type is \`*const [5:0]u8\` — a pointer to a null-terminated array of 5 bytes. That clunky type **automatically coerces** to \`[]const u8\` whenever a slice is expected:

\`\`\`zig
fn greet(name: []const u8) void { /* ... */ }
greet("world"); // string literal coerces to slice — no fuss
\`\`\`

The trailing zero exists for C interop; pass \`s.ptr\` to a C function expecting a \`char *\` and it'll find the null where it expects.

## UTF-8 by convention

String literals in Zig source are UTF-8. The standard library treats strings as byte sequences — there's no built-in grapheme-aware string type. You can iterate a slice and get individual bytes, which works for ASCII but splits multi-byte UTF-8 codepoints. For Unicode work, use \`std.unicode\` (covered in advanced material).

## Comparison

\`==\` doesn't work on slices. Always:

\`\`\`zig
const std = @import("std");
if (std.mem.eql(u8, a, b)) {}
\`\`\`

For substring search:

\`\`\`zig
if (std.mem.indexOf(u8, haystack, needle)) |i| {
    std.debug.print("found at {d}\\n", .{i});
}
\`\`\`

For case-insensitive ASCII: \`std.ascii.eqlIgnoreCase\`.

## Mutable strings

\`var\` strings start out as constants too:

\`\`\`zig
var s: []const u8 = "hello";
s[0] = 'H'; // compile error: writing through const slice
\`\`\`

To mutate bytes you need \`[]u8\` and a backing buffer:

\`\`\`zig

const s: []u8 = &buf;
s[0] = 'H';

const User = struct {
    id: u64,
    power: i32 = 0,        // default value
    name: []const u8,
};

const u: User = .{ .id = 1, .name = "Goku", .power = 9001 };
\`\`\`

Fields list a name, a colon, and a type. Trailing comma after each field is required (Zig's parser doesn't tolerate omitting it). Defaults are optional — \`power = 0\` lets the caller skip that field at construction.

## Methods

Methods are functions whose first parameter is a value or pointer to the struct:

\`\`\`zig
const User = struct {
    id: u64,
    power: i32,

    fn levelUp(self: *User) void {
        self.power += 1;
    }

    fn describe(self: User) void {
        std.debug.print("user {d} power {d}\\n", .{ self.id, self.power });
    }
};
\`\`\`

Call them with dot syntax — \`u.levelUp()\` is sugar for \`User.levelUp(&u)\`. The first parameter conventionally named \`self\` (you'll also see authors use the struct's name).

## Pointer vs value receiver

- Method takes \`self: *User\` → it can mutate the struct. Pass via reference.
- Method takes \`self: User\` → it gets a copy. Read-only.
- Method takes \`self: *const User\` → can read through pointer but not mutate.

Zig auto-takes-address-of when you call a method that wants \`*Self\` on a regular value, so the call site doesn't change.

## init / deinit

A common pattern is a static \`init\` constructor that builds the struct and a \`deinit\` method that releases its resources:

\`\`\`zig
const Game = struct {
    players: []Player,

    fn init(allocator: std.mem.Allocator, count: usize) !Game {
        return .{ .players = try allocator.alloc(Player, count) };
    }

    fn deinit(self: Game, allocator: std.mem.Allocator) void {
        allocator.free(self.players);
    }
};
\`\`\`

This shows up everywhere in the standard library. We'll cover the heap mechanics in chapter 9.

## Anonymous struct literals

\`.{ .id = 1, .name = "x", .power = 0 }\` is **anonymous** — Zig figures out the type from context. It works for return values, arguments, and any spot where the type is known. If the type isn't clear from context, you'd write \`User{ ... }\` to disambiguate.`,

      body: `## Declaring

\`\`\`zig
const Status = enum {
    pending,
    active,
    archived,
};

const s: Status = .pending;
\`\`\`

Variants are bare identifiers — no \`Status.\` prefix at the declaration. They're internally numbered \`0\`, \`1\`, \`2\` in declaration order; you can override with explicit values:

\`\`\`zig
const Permission = enum(u8) {
    read = 0b001,
    write = 0b010,
    execute = 0b100,
};
\`\`\`

The \`enum(u8)\` says the underlying type is \`u8\`.

## Enum literals

Within a context where the type is known (assignment, return, comparison) you can omit the type name and write just \`.variant\`:

\`\`\`zig
fn statusLabel(s: Status) []const u8 {
    return switch (s) {
        .pending => "pending",
        .active => "active",
        .archived => "archived",
    };
}
\`\`\`

This is one of Zig's most-used niceties.

## Methods

Just like structs, enums can have methods:

\`\`\`zig
const Stage = enum {
    draft,
    review,
    published,

    fn isComplete(self: Stage) bool {
        return self == .published;
    }
};

if (stage.isComplete()) { /* ... */ }
\`\`\`

## \`@tagName\`

The \`@tagName\` builtin returns the variant name as a \`[]const u8\` slice:

\`\`\`zig
std.debug.print("status = {s}\\n", .{@tagName(s)});
// status = pending
\`\`\`

## Exhaustive switching

A \`switch\` over an enum without an \`else =>\` branch must list every variant. If you later add a fourth status, every such switch becomes a compile error until you handle the new case. This is the safety property that makes enums worth using even for simple state machines.`,
      symbols: [
        {
          pattern: "@tagName",
          signature: "@tagName(value: anytype) []const u8",
          description: "Returns the name of an enum variant or tagged-union active field as a string slice.",
        },
      ],
    }),

    reading({
      id: "tagged-unions",
      title: "Tagged unions",
      objectives: [
        "Build a sum type with payload-bearing variants",
        "Switch on a tagged union with field captures",
      ],
      body: `A tagged union is Zig's sum type: a value that can be ONE of several differently-typed alternatives, with the active alternative tracked at runtime.

\`\`\`zig
const Money = union(enum) {
    cents: u64,
    iou: []const u8,
    nothing,
};

const a = Money{ .cents = 1500 };
const b = Money{ .iou = "Bob owes me a coffee" };
const c = Money.nothing; // void variant — initialise without a payload
\`\`\`

The \`union(enum)\` says "and produce a hidden enum that mirrors the field names". You can also explicitly name the tag enum:

\`\`\`zig
const MoneyKind = enum { cents, iou, nothing };
const Money = union(MoneyKind) {
    cents: u64,
    iou: []const u8,
    nothing,
};
\`\`\`

## Switching with capture

\`\`\`zig
fn describe(m: Money) []const u8 {
    return switch (m) {
        .cents => |amount| std.fmt.allocPrint(allocator, "{d}¢", .{amount}),
        .iou => |who| who,
        .nothing => "broke",
    };
}
\`\`\`

The \`|amount|\` after the arrow is a **capture** — within that arm \`amount\` has the type of the \`cents\` field (\`u64\`).

## Why tagged unions?

They model "this is exactly one of \`A\`, \`B\`, or \`C\`" without subtyping or inheritance. Common uses:

- AST nodes (\`Expr.binary\`, \`Expr.literal\`, \`Expr.call\`).
- Result-shaped error returns where you want to keep the error data alongside the success.
- State machines where each state carries different data.

Combined with exhaustive \`switch\`, you get type-safe pattern matching that the compiler keeps current as the union grows.

## Untagged unions

\`union { ... }\` (no \`(enum)\` after) gives you a raw union with no discriminant. You're responsible for tracking which field is active. Used for very narrow cases like reinterpreting bits.`,

      title: "Optionals — `?T`",

        "Recognise the `?T` type",
        "Unwrap with `.?`, `if (x) |v|`, and `orelse`",

      body: `An **optional** type holds either \`null\` or a value of type \`T\`. Written \`?T\`:

\`\`\`zig
var home: ?[]const u8 = null;
var name: ?[]const u8 = "Leto";
\`\`\`

Optionals are NOT pointers (though pointers can themselves be optional, \`?*User\`). They carry an extra tag bit that says whether the value is present.

## Unwrapping safely with \`if\`

\`\`\`zig
if (home) |h| {
    std.debug.print("home: {s}\\n", .{h}); // h is a []const u8 here
} else {
    std.debug.print("no home\\n", .{});
}
\`\`\`

Inside the \`|h|\` arm, \`h\` has type \`[]const u8\` — the optional has been peeled off. This is the safest unwrap form because the compiler keeps both branches in scope.

## \`orelse\` for defaults

\`\`\`zig
const display = home orelse "unknown";
\`\`\`

\`orelse\` evaluates its right side **only when the left is null**. Useful for defaults:

\`\`\`zig
const owner = lookup.get(key) orelse return error.NotFound;
const port = parsePort(arg) orelse 8080;
\`\`\`

Note the right side can be \`return …\` — an early exit chained into the same expression.

## \`.?\` — unwrap or panic

\`\`\`zig
const h = home.?; // panic if null in debug; UB in release-fast
\`\`\`

Use \`.?\` only when you've **proven** at the call site that the value isn't null (you just checked, you constructed it, etc.). For uncertain values, prefer \`if\` or \`orelse\`.

## Optional chains

You can chain optional accesses through tagged unions and structs. If any step is null, the whole chain is null. There's no special operator like Swift's \`?.\` — you just keep wrapping in \`if (x) |v|\`.

## When NOT to use optionals

Use them for "value or absence" semantics. Don't use them for **errors** — that's what error unions are for (next lesson). The compiler treats them differently and the idioms diverge.`,

      ],
      body: `Errors in Zig are values. There's no exception machinery, no stack unwinding, no virtual call. An error union is a regular value the caller has to handle.

## Error sets

\`\`\`zig
const ParseError = error {
    Empty,
    OutOfRange,
    BadDigit,
};
\`\`\`

An error set is just an enum-like declaration. \`error.Empty\` produces a value of type \`ParseError\` (or any superset that includes it).

## Error unions

A function that can fail returns \`Set!T\` — read as "either a member of \`Set\` or a value of type \`T\`":

\`\`\`zig
fn parsePositive(s: []const u8) ParseError!u32 {
    if (s.len == 0) return error.Empty;
    var x: u32 = 0;
    for (s) |c| {
        if (c < '0' or c > '9') return error.BadDigit;
        x = x * 10 + (c - '0');
    }
    return x;
}
\`\`\`

The leading \`!\` separates the error set (left) from the success type (right).

## Inferred error sets

If you write \`!T\` (no error set on the left), Zig **infers** the set from every \`return error.X\` in the body. This is convenient for functions that bubble errors from helpers:

\`\`\`zig
fn getUserConfig() !User {
    const path = try findConfigPath();
    const text = try readFile(path);
    return parseUser(text);
}
\`\`\`

The downside is that callers see "any error this function might return" — the compiler can still check exhaustively but documentation suffers. For library functions that other people will catch errors from, prefer an explicit set.

## Special: \`anyerror\`

\`anyerror\` is the universal error set — every error coerces into it. Use it sparingly; it's a "give up on tracking specifics" tool.`,
      glossary: [G.errorUnion],
    }),

    reading({
      id: "try-and-catch",
      title: "try and catch",
      objectives: [
        "Use `try` to propagate errors",
        "Handle errors with `catch` and `catch |err|`",
        "Switch on error variants in a `catch`",
      ],
      body: `## try

\`try expr\` is shorthand for \`expr catch |err| return err\`. It's the idiomatic way to bubble an error up:

\`\`\`zig
fn save(path: []const u8, data: []const u8) !void {
    const f = try std.fs.cwd().createFile(path, .{});
    defer f.close();
    try f.writeAll(data);
}
\`\`\`

If \`createFile\` fails, the error returns from \`save\`. If \`writeAll\` fails, the \`defer f.close()\` still runs first, then the error returns.

## catch with a default

\`\`\`zig
const port = parsePort(s) catch 8080;
\`\`\`

When the expression returns an error, evaluate the right side and use that value instead. Like \`orelse\` for optionals.

## catch with the error captured

\`\`\`zig
const data = readFile(path) catch |err| {
    std.debug.print("read failed: {}\\n", .{err});
    return err;
};
\`\`\`

The \`|err|\` captures the specific error. You can then log it, return a different error, or recover.

## catch + switch — exhaustive error handling

\`\`\`zig
const text = parseConfig(input) catch |err| switch (err) {
    error.Empty => return error.MissingConfig,
    error.BadDigit, error.OutOfRange => return error.InvalidConfig,
};
\`\`\`

Combining \`catch |err|\` with a \`switch\` lets you handle every case explicitly — exhaustive, like enum switching.

## Where errors fit

\`!T\` works through your call stack just like a regular return. Combine with optionals when "absence" and "failure" are different concerns:

\`\`\`zig
fn lookupUser(id: u64) !?User {
    // !?User = "this might fail; if it doesn't, the user might still be missing"
}

const maybe_user = try lookupUser(id);

    reading({
      id: "address-of",
      title: "Pointers and the `&` operator",
      objectives: [
        "Take the address of a value with `&`",
        "Recognise the type `*T` (pointer to T)",
        "Use `.*` to dereference",
      ],
      body: `## The basics

Every variable lives at a memory address. The \`&\` operator gives you that address as a pointer:

\`\`\`zig
var x: i32 = 42;
const p: *i32 = &x;  // pointer to x

std.debug.print("addr: {*}\\n", .{p}); // prints something like 0x16fdff0bc
std.debug.print("val:  {d}\\n", .{p.*}); // 42
\`\`\`

The \`{*}\` format prints the pointer's address; \`p.*\` dereferences it.

## Reading and writing through a pointer

\`\`\`zig
var y: i32 = 1;
const py = &y;
py.* = 99;            // write
const v = py.*;       // read
std.debug.print("{d}\\n", .{y}); // 99
\`\`\`

\`.*\` works on both sides of an assignment.

## \`*T\` vs \`*const T\`

\`\`\`zig
var x: i32 = 1;
const writer: *i32 = &x;       // can write through
const reader: *const i32 = &x; // can read but not write
writer.* = 7; // ok
reader.* = 7; // compile error: writing through const pointer
\`\`\`

Pointer constness is independent of the variable's own constness — but you can't take a mutable pointer to a \`const\` value:

\`\`\`zig
const x: i32 = 1;
const p: *i32 = &x; // compile error: cast discards const qualifier
\`\`\`

## Pointers vs slices

A pointer \`*T\` points at exactly one \`T\`. A slice \`[]T\` is a pointer plus a length — useful for runs of elements. There's also \`[*]T\` — a "many-item pointer" — when you need C-style "pointer to a sequence of unknown length"; you'll see it interfacing with C.`,
    }),

    reading({
      id: "pass-by-pointer",
      title: "Pass by value vs pass by pointer",
      objectives: [
        "Recognise that Zig passes by value by default",
        "Use a `*T` parameter to mutate caller state",
      ],
      body: `Function parameters in Zig are **immutable copies**. Passing a struct copies it (the optimiser may elide the copy, but semantically you get a copy).

\`\`\`zig
fn levelUpByValue(u: User) void {
    u.power += 1; // compile error — u is const
}
\`\`\`

To let a function mutate caller state, pass a pointer:

\`\`\`zig
fn levelUp(u: *User) void {
    u.power += 1;
}

var user: User = .{ .id = 1, .power = 100 };
levelUp(&user);
std.debug.print("{d}\\n", .{user.power}); // 101
\`\`\`

Two things to notice:
- The caller writes \`&user\` to take the address.
- Inside the function, you write \`u.power\` — Zig auto-dereferences for field access, so you don't need \`u.*.power\`.

## When to pass a pointer

- The function needs to mutate the value.
- The struct is large and a copy would be wasteful.
- The function takes ownership of resources behind the value (e.g. internal allocations).

For small \`const\` values (an \`i32\`, a small struct, a slice — itself just two words) pass by value. The optimiser will pick the right machine-level convention.

## Methods and self

When you call \`user.levelUp()\` and the method takes \`self: *User\`, Zig **automatically takes the address** for you. You don't write \`(&user).levelUp()\`. The compiler insists the underlying \`var\` is mutable — calling a \`*Self\` method on a \`const\` value is a compile error:

\`\`\`zig
const u: User = .{ .id = 1, .power = 100 };
u.levelUp(); // error: cannot pass a const reference to a non-const method
\`\`\`

This is one of those places Zig's strictness is unusual but appreciated: you can't accidentally mutate something you'd promised not to.`,

A \`Node\` would need to contain a \`Node\` would need to contain a \`Node\`… infinite. Pointers solve it: a pointer is the same size (one machine word) regardless of what it points to.

        "Distinguish global data, stack, and heap",
        "Recognise how each is allocated and freed",
      ],
      body: `Zig — like C and Rust — exposes three memory areas. Knowing where a value lives tells you when it dies.

## 1. Global data

String literals, \`const\` declarations at file scope, anything baked into the binary. Lifetime: the whole process.

\`\`\`zig
const greeting = "hello"; // baked into the executable's read-only data
\`\`\`

You can read it forever; you can never free it; it's already there before \`main\`.

## 2. The call stack

Every function call pushes a **stack frame** containing that function's parameters and local variables. When the function returns, the frame is popped. Lifetime: until the function returns.

\`\`\`zig
fn doStuff() void {
    var local: i32 = 42; // lives in this function's frame
    // ... use local ...
} // frame popped, \`local\` gone
\`\`\`

This is fast (no allocator needed) and automatic (no free needed). The catch: a value can't outlive its frame. Returning a pointer to a local is a bug.

## 3. The heap

Memory you ask an allocator for. Lifetime: until you (or your allocator) free it.

\`\`\`zig
const u = try allocator.create(User);
// ... use u ...
allocator.destroy(u);
\`\`\`

The heap is for values whose size or count isn't known at compile time, or whose lifetime needs to outlast the function that creates them.

## Why care?

Most languages hide this. Zig doesn't, because:
- The program runs faster when you allocate consciously.
- Bugs at the boundary (use-after-free, leaks) are easier to spot when you wrote the allocate/free yourself.
- You can pick a strategy that fits the workload — bump-allocate per request, recycle via arena, page-tier for known-large blobs.`,
    }),

    reading({
      id: "dangling-pointers",
      title: "The dangling-pointer trap",

        "Recognise the bug of returning a pointer to a local",
        "Apply the fix: return by value, or move to the heap",
      ],
      body: `Here's the canonical bug:

\`\`\`zig
fn newUser() *User {
    var u = User{ .id = 1, .power = 100 };
    return &u; // BUG: the local goes away when we return
}

const u = newUser();
std.debug.print("{d}\\n", .{u.power}); // garbage / panic
\`\`\`

\`u\` is a local — it lives in \`newUser\`'s stack frame. When \`newUser\` returns, the frame is popped. The pointer \`u\` we got back now points at memory that's been **reused** by the next function call. Reading through it gets you whatever ended up there next.

The compiler doesn't catch this in current Zig — it's on you to spot it.

## Two clean fixes

**Return the value itself.** Small, copyable structs are happy to be returned by value:

\`\`\`zig
fn newUser() User {
    return .{ .id = 1, .power = 100 };
}

const u = newUser();
\`\`\`

The struct is copied into \`u\` at the call site. No pointers, no danger. The compiler may elide the copy (NRVO).

**Allocate on the heap.** When the value really must outlive multiple call frames, allocate:

\`\`\`zig
fn newUser(allocator: std.mem.Allocator) !*User {
    const u = try allocator.create(User);
    u.* = .{ .id = 1, .power = 100 };
    return u;
}

const u = try newUser(allocator);
defer allocator.destroy(u);
\`\`\`

The \`u\` lives until the caller \`destroy\`s it.

## What about slices?

Same trap, slightly subtler. A slice carries a pointer plus a length — if you return a slice that points into a local array, you've created a dangling slice:

\`\`\`zig
fn makeBuf() []const u8 {
    var buf = [_]u8{ 'h', 'i' };
    return &buf; // ALSO A BUG — buf goes away
}
\`\`\`

The fix is the same: return by value (a fixed-size array, copied) or allocate on the heap.

## When in doubt

Ask: "where does this value live, and when does it die?" If the answer is "in some function's stack frame" then the value can only be used **inside** that frame. Anything else is a bug.`,

## The Allocator type

\`std.mem.Allocator\` is a small interface — a vtable that exposes \`alloc\`, \`free\`, \`resize\`, \`create\`, and \`destroy\`. You don't implement it directly; you get one from a concrete allocator and pass it around:

\`\`\`zig
fn loadConfig(allocator: std.mem.Allocator) !Config {
    const buf = try allocator.alloc(u8, 4096);
    defer allocator.free(buf);
    // ...
}
\`\`\`

## alloc / free — slices

\`\`\`zig
const buf = try allocator.alloc(u8, 1024);
defer allocator.free(buf);
\`\`\`

\`alloc(T, n)\` returns \`![]T\` — an error union of slice. The slice has \`len == n\`, with uninitialised contents. You **must** \`free\` it once.

## create / destroy — single values

\`\`\`zig
const user = try allocator.create(User);
defer allocator.destroy(user);
user.* = .{ .id = 1, .power = 100 };
\`\`\`

\`create(T)\` returns \`!*T\`. \`destroy(ptr)\` releases the memory.

## defer is your friend

\`defer\` schedules a statement to run when the **scope** (block) exits — whether normally, by \`return\`, or by an error returning out. Pair every \`alloc\` with a \`defer free\` on the line below; you can't forget then.

\`\`\`zig
const a = try allocator.alloc(u8, 100);
defer allocator.free(a);

const b = try allocator.alloc(u8, 200);
defer allocator.free(b); // runs FIRST (defers run in reverse order)
\`\`\`

## errdefer for partial init

When initialisation has multiple steps and a later step might fail, \`errdefer\` cleans up only when the scope exits **via an error**:

\`\`\`zig
fn init(allocator: std.mem.Allocator) !Game {
    const players = try allocator.alloc(Player, 4);
    errdefer allocator.free(players);

    const history = try allocator.alloc(Move, 100);
    errdefer allocator.free(history);

    return .{ .players = players, .history = history };
}
\`\`\`

If \`alloc(Player)\` succeeds and \`alloc(Move)\` fails, the \`errdefer allocator.free(players)\` fires and we don't leak. On success, both errdefers are skipped because the scope exits normally.`,

      body: `Zig ships several allocators in the standard library, each with different trade-offs.

## std.heap.GeneralPurposeAllocator (GPA / DebugAllocator)

The default-ish allocator for development. Detects double-free, use-after-free, and leaks (in debug builds).

\`\`\`zig
var gpa: std.heap.GeneralPurposeAllocator(.{}) = .{};
defer _ = gpa.deinit();
const allocator = gpa.allocator();
\`\`\`

Use it in development. Its leak detection on \`deinit()\` is the cheapest way to find missing \`free\`s.

> [!NOTE]
> In Zig 0.13+ this is sometimes named \`std.heap.DebugAllocator\` — both names refer to the same implementation as it's transitioned.

## std.heap.ArenaAllocator

A bump allocator that frees everything at once on \`deinit\`. Individual \`free\` calls are no-ops.

\`\`\`zig
var arena = std.heap.ArenaAllocator.init(parent_allocator);
defer arena.deinit(); // frees every alloc made through \`arena.allocator()\`
const a = arena.allocator();

// Within the scope, alloc as much as you want — no per-alloc free needed.
const x = try a.alloc(u8, 1000);
const y = try a.alloc(u8, 2000);
\`\`\`

Perfect for **request-scoped** work — parsing a file, building a response, running a single test. You allocate a thousand small things, then \`deinit\` reclaims it all in one shot.

## std.heap.FixedBufferAllocator

Allocates from a stack-or-static buffer you provide. No heap at all.

\`\`\`zig
var buf: [4096]u8 = undefined;
var fba = std.heap.FixedBufferAllocator.init(&buf);
const a = fba.allocator();

const x = try a.alloc(u8, 100);
const y = try a.alloc(u8, 100);
// fba.reset() to discard everything
\`\`\`

Great for **bounded** workloads where you don't need general malloc — small embedded systems, hot paths where every allocation needs to be predictable.

## std.heap.page_allocator

Goes straight to the OS. Slow per-call (an mmap or VirtualAlloc) but zero overhead. Use as a backing allocator for one of the above, or for one-off large blobs.

## std.heap.c_allocator

Wraps the C runtime's \`malloc\`/\`free\`. Fast, well-tuned. Use in release builds when you want libc behaviour:

\`\`\`zig
const allocator = if (@import("builtin").mode == .Debug)
    gpa.allocator()
else
    std.heap.c_allocator;
\`\`\`

## std.testing.allocator

The allocator the test runner injects via \`zig test\`. Reports leak locations on test exit. We use this in unit tests inside a project.

## Quick decision flow

| Workload | Pick |
|---|---|
| App startup, long-lived | GeneralPurposeAllocator (debug), c_allocator (release) |
| Per-request scratch | ArenaAllocator |
| No-heap embedded | FixedBufferAllocator |
| One huge slab | page_allocator |
| Inside a unit test | std.testing.allocator |`,

        "Force evaluation at compile time with `comptime`",
        "Recognise comptime function parameters",
      ],
      body: `Zig's secret weapon is **comptime** — the same language, executed during compilation. Anything you can do at runtime, you can do at compile time. That includes building types.

## Comptime values

A value is **comptime-known** if the compiler can compute it without running your program. Literal numbers, \`const\` declarations whose initialisers are themselves comptime, and the result of any function called from a comptime context.

\`\`\`zig
const square = comptime computeSquare(7); // forced comptime
fn computeSquare(x: i32) i32 { return x * x; }
\`\`\`

The body of \`computeSquare\` runs at compile time and \`square\` ends up as the literal \`49\` in the binary.

## comptime function parameters

A parameter declared with \`comptime\` must receive a comptime-known argument:

\`\`\`zig
fn repeat(comptime msg: []const u8, n: usize) void {
    var i: usize = 0;
    while (i < n) : (i += 1) {
        std.debug.print("{s}\\n", .{msg});
    }
}

repeat("hi", 3);  // ok
const buf: []const u8 = readUserInput();
repeat(buf, 3);   // compile error: msg must be comptime-known
\`\`\`

This is how Zig knows to specialise the function: \`msg\` is baked into each instantiation.

## comptime_int and comptime_float

Numeric literals start as \`comptime_int\` or \`comptime_float\` — types with unbounded precision that exist only during compilation. They coerce to any concrete numeric type that fits:

\`\`\`zig
const a: u8 = 100;          // 100 is comptime_int → fits → u8
const b: u64 = 1_000_000;   // fits → u64
const c: u8 = 1_000;        // doesn't fit → compile error
\`\`\`

## Why this matters

Comptime is how Zig avoids needing macros, templates, and a separate metaprogramming language. The compiler is the build script — generics, conditional compilation, code generation are all written in regular Zig that runs at the right time.`,
      glossary: [G.comptime],
    }),

    reading({
      id: "type-as-value",
      title: "Types are values",
      objectives: [
        "Recognise that `type` is itself a type",
        "Write a function that returns a type",
        "Build a generic struct via a type-returning function",
      ],
      body: `In Zig, **\`type\` is a type**. You can pass it around, store it in \`const\`s, return it from functions — at compile time. That's how you write generics.

## Functions that return types

\`\`\`zig
fn ArrayOf(comptime T: type, comptime N: usize) type {
    return [N]T;
}

const FourInts = ArrayOf(i32, 4); // FourInts == [4]i32
const xs: FourInts = .{ 1, 2, 3, 4 };
\`\`\`

The function \`ArrayOf\` runs at compile time and returns a type. By convention, type-returning functions are **PascalCase** because the result is a type.

## Generic structs

The same idea generalises. A generic container is a function that takes a type and returns a struct definition:

\`\`\`zig
fn List(comptime T: type) type {
    return struct {
        items: []T,
        len: usize,

        const Self = @This();

        pub fn first(self: Self) ?T {
            if (self.len == 0) return null;
            return self.items[0];
        }
    };
}

const Ints = List(i32);
const ints: Ints = .{ .items = &[_]i32{ 10, 20, 30 }, .len = 3 };
std.debug.print("{any}\\n", .{ints.first()}); // 10
\`\`\`

\`@This()\` returns the enclosing struct (here the anonymous one defined inside \`List\`), so methods can reference \`Self\`.

## Specialisation, not type erasure

Each call to \`List(i32)\` produces a **distinct** type at compile time. \`List(i32)\` and \`List(u8)\` are unrelated types — calling a method that accepts \`List(i32)\` with a \`List(u8)\` is a compile error. This is closer to C++ templates than to Java's type-erased generics.

## comptime everywhere

Anywhere a type is expected, you can compute it at compile time:

\`\`\`zig
fn printSlice(slice: anytype) void {
    const T = @TypeOf(slice);
    std.debug.print("type {s}, len {d}\\n", .{ @typeName(T), slice.len });
}
\`\`\`

      body: `\`anytype\` is the lighter-weight cousin of \`comptime T: type\`. It says "this parameter accepts any type; the compiler will specialise the function for each type it gets".

\`\`\`zig
fn writeFor(out: anytype, msg: []const u8) !void {
    try out.writeAll(msg);
}
\`\`\`

\`out\` could be a \`std.fs.File.Writer\`, a \`std.ArrayList(u8).Writer\`, your own type — anything with a compatible \`writeAll\` method. The compiler generates one specialisation per type, and each specialisation type-checks separately.

## anytype vs comptime T

\`\`\`zig
fn dump1(x: anytype) void { std.debug.print("{}\\n", .{x}); }
fn dump2(comptime T: type, x: T) void { std.debug.print("{}\\n", .{x}); }
\`\`\`

\`dump1\` is concise. \`dump2\` lets the compiler check the type explicitly. Reach for \`anytype\` for one-off helpers, \`comptime T: type\` when you want to share the type across multiple parameters or reference it by name.

## Inspecting an anytype

You usually combine \`anytype\` with the type-introspection builtins:

\`\`\`zig
fn describe(x: anytype) void {
    const T = @TypeOf(x);
    std.debug.print("got a {s}\\n", .{@typeName(T)});
}
\`\`\`

## When anytype goes wrong

Because \`anytype\` is duck-typed, a missing method shows up as a compile error **at instantiation**, not at the function definition. The error points at the first \`out.writeAll(...)\` call inside \`writeFor\`. This can confuse new readers — but the messages are usually decent.

For library APIs that you want to feel like proper interfaces, take the type explicitly (\`comptime W: type\`) or constrain via \`@hasDecl\`/\`@hasField\` checks at the function entry.`,

> Zig 0.15.1 made \`ArrayList\` **unmanaged by default** — the allocator is no longer stored on the list and you pass it to every mutating method. This lesson uses the 0.15.1 / 0.16 form. If you're on Zig 0.14 or older, replace each \`list.append(allocator, x)\` call with \`list.append(x)\` and \`list.deinit(allocator)\` with \`list.deinit()\`.

## Construction

\`\`\`zig
const std = @import("std");

var list: std.ArrayList(i32) = .empty;
defer list.deinit(allocator);
\`\`\`

The \`.empty\` literal is a stable initial value (zero items, zero capacity). The list itself doesn't carry an allocator — you pass one to every mutating call. \`defer list.deinit(allocator)\` releases the backing buffer when the scope exits.

## Operations

\`\`\`zig
try list.append(allocator, 10);
try list.append(allocator, 20);
try list.append(allocator, 30);

std.debug.print("first: {d}\\n", .{list.items[0]});  // 10
std.debug.print("count: {d}\\n", .{list.items.len}); // 3
\`\`\`

The backing slice is exposed as \`list.items\`. It's the same shape as \`[]T\` and works with \`for\` loops directly:

\`\`\`zig
for (list.items) |n| std.debug.print("{d}\\n", .{n});
\`\`\`

## When the buffer grows

\`append\` may need to grow the backing array. When it does, the OLD pointer becomes invalid — anything you stored that points _into_ the list is dangling. Don't do this:

\`\`\`zig
const ptr = &list.items[0];
try list.append(allocator, 99); // may relocate the buffer
ptr.* = 1; // BUG: ptr might be dangling
\`\`\`

Same rule as Rust's borrow checker, except Zig doesn't enforce it for you. Read what you need, append, then re-fetch.

## Removing elements

\`\`\`zig
const tail = list.pop();             // returns ?T — null when empty
list.swapRemove(2);                   // O(1) — replaces index 2 with the last item then pops
list.orderedRemove(2);                // O(n) — preserves order
list.clearRetainingCapacity();        // empty the list, keep the buffer
list.clearAndFree(allocator);         // empty the list, also free the buffer
\`\`\`

## ArrayList(u8) is a string builder

Append bytes / strings (e.g. \`try list.appendSlice(allocator, "hi")\`), then read \`list.items\` as a \`[]u8\`. For formatted output you can wrap the list in a writer with \`list.writer(allocator)\` and \`writer.print("{d}", .{n})\` into it.

## Why "unmanaged" by default?

Storing the allocator on the list adds 16 bytes per instance. For programs with many small lists (think: nodes in a graph, rows in a parser) that adds up. Making the unmanaged variant the default also forces the allocator-flow to be explicit at every call site — the same trade-off Zig makes everywhere: a tiny convenience tax for a permanent visibility win.`,

## Construction

\`\`\`zig
var lookup = std.StringHashMap(u32).init(allocator);
defer lookup.deinit();

try lookup.put("rust", 1);
try lookup.put("go", 2);
try lookup.put("zig", 3);

if (lookup.get("zig")) |v| std.debug.print("{d}\\n", .{v}); // 3
\`\`\`

\`get\` returns \`?V\` — \`null\` when the key isn't present.

## Key ownership

This is the part that catches new Zig users. The map **does not copy your keys** — it stores the slice you handed it. If your key is a string literal (lives forever), no problem. But if your key was a temp buffer:

\`\`\`zig
var buf: [16]u8 = undefined;
const name = try readName(&buf);
try lookup.put(name, 42); // BUG: name points into buf
const next_name = try readName(&buf);
// lookup's key now garbled — the buffer was reused
\`\`\`

Fix it by **duplicating** the key so it has its own lifetime:

\`\`\`zig
const owned = try allocator.dupe(u8, name);
try lookup.put(owned, 42);
\`\`\`

You're now responsible for freeing \`owned\` when the entry leaves the map. Iterate \`lookup.keyIterator()\` and free each, or stash the keys somewhere else for tracked ownership.

## Iteration

\`\`\`zig
var it = lookup.iterator();
while (it.next()) |entry| {
    std.debug.print("{s} = {d}\\n", .{ entry.key_ptr.*, entry.value_ptr.* });
}
\`\`\`

\`entry.key_ptr\` and \`entry.value_ptr\` are pointers into the map's storage — careful not to keep them around past a \`put\` that might rehash.

## Common operations

| Method | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| \`put(k, v)\` | Insert or overwrite. |
| \`get(k)\` | Read; returns \`?V\`. |
| \`getPtr(k)\` | Pointer to the slot's value (mutable). |
| \`remove(k)\` | Remove entry, returns whether one existed. |
| \`contains(k)\` | Boolean check. |

// Into a fixed buffer (no allocation):

const msg = try std.fmt.bufPrint(&buf, "user {d}: {s}", .{ id, name });

\`bufPrint\` returns a slice into your buffer of the actual bytes written. Useful for hot paths where allocation isn't welcome.

\`\`\`zig
// Allocates a fresh slice:
const msg = try std.fmt.allocPrint(allocator, "user {d}: {s}", .{ id, name });

\`allocPrint\` is the convenient form when you need an owned string back.

| Spec | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| \`{d}\` | integers | base 10 |
| \`{x}\` | integers | hexadecimal |
| \`{b}\` | integers | binary |
| \`{s}\` | \`[]const u8\` | string |

You can combine alignment, fill, width: \`{d:5}\` right-aligns to width 5, \`{d:<5}\` left-aligns, \`{d:0>5}\` zero-pads.

## std.mem helpers

A few you'll reach for constantly:

\`\`\`zig
std.mem.eql(u8, a, b)              // byte equality
std.mem.startsWith(u8, s, prefix)
std.mem.endsWith(u8, s, suffix)
std.mem.indexOf(u8, haystack, needle) // first index, ?usize
std.mem.indexOfScalar(u8, s, byte)    // first byte index, ?usize
std.mem.split(u8, s, " ")              // splitter iterator
std.mem.tokenize(u8, s, " \\t\\n")      // like split but skips empties
std.mem.trim(u8, s, " \\t\\n")          // strip from both ends

## The type-returning special case

A function that **returns a type** is named PascalCase. It looks like a type at the call site:

\`\`\`zig
fn ArrayList(comptime T: type) type { /* ... */ } // PascalCase
const List = ArrayList(i32);
\`\`\`

Same rule applies to builtins: \`@TypeOf\` is PascalCase because its result is a type.

## Files vs modules

Filenames are \`snake_case.zig\`. The exception is files that are entirely a struct definition — you'll often see those named after the struct in PascalCase (e.g., \`User.zig\` re-exports a single struct).

## Multi-word constants

\`\`\`zig
const max_retries = 3;
const default_buffer_size: usize = 4096;
\`\`\`

\`SCREAMING_SNAKE\` is uncommon in Zig — \`snake_case\` is preferred even for compile-time constants.

## Acronyms

The convention is to capitalise only the first letter:

\`\`\`zig
const HttpClient = struct { /* ... */ };  // not HTTPClient
const tcpStream = ...;                      // not TCPStream
\`\`\`

This matches how PascalCase reads in casual prose — easier to chunk by syllable.`,

Mark deliberate ignores with \`_\`:

\`\`\`zig
fn foo(a: i32, b: i32) i32 {
    _ = b;
    return a;
}
\`\`\`

Same trick for return values you don't care about:

\`\`\`zig
_ = list.pop();
_ = try someComputation();
\`\`\`

This is annoying for two days, then permanent peace of mind: dead code can't accumulate, and reviewers know every parameter genuinely matters.

## Why \`_ = b;\` and not \`_ = ...;\`?

\`_\` is the discard slot — assignments to it just evaluate the RHS and throw it away. The lhs has type \`anyopaque\`-ish behaviour: any value coerces.

## No shadowing

Zig prevents declaring a name that hides an enclosing one:

\`\`\`zig
fn outer(x: i32) void {
    const x: i32 = 0; // error: redeclaration of \`x\`
}
\`\`\`

This rules out a class of bugs where a tighter scope accidentally redefines an outer variable. Conscious developers reach for unambiguous names instead.

Three patterns reinforce each other:

1. **\`init\` takes the allocator**, stores it on the struct, and returns either the struct or an error.
2. **\`errdefer\` after each successful step** unwinds partial state if a later step fails.
3. **\`deinit\` mirrors \`init\`** in reverse — close the connection before freeing buffers, undo what you set up last first.

## Why store the allocator?

\`deinit\` needs the same allocator that \`init\` used. There are three styles:

- **Store on the struct** (shown above). Most flexible. Slightly fatter struct.
- **Pass to deinit explicitly**: \`deinit(self: *Self, allocator: Allocator)\`. Newer "unmanaged" pattern.
- **Hard-code the allocator**: only works for true singletons.

Pick a style and stick with it across a project — mixing surprises future readers.

## Use-after-deinit

After \`x.deinit()\`, you must not touch \`x\`. Zig doesn't track this for you. A common pattern is to assign \`undefined\` to the local so accidents are easier to catch in debug builds:

\`\`\`zig
list.deinit();
list = undefined;

        "Plan the API before writing code",
      ],
      body: `Time to put it all together. This capstone builds a tiny in-memory key-value store with these operations:

- \`set(key, value)\` — insert or overwrite
- \`get(key)\` — fetch (returns optional)
- \`delete(key)\` — remove
- \`size()\` — count of live entries
- \`keys(allocator)\` — return a freshly-allocated slice of the keys

It's small but exercises every chapter: structs (Store), allocators (passed to \`init\`), error unions (insertion can fail), optionals (\`get\` returns \`?V\`), the standard-library hashmap, and ownership rules (we duplicate keys so the caller's buffers can be reused).

## API sketch

\`\`\`zig
pub const Store = struct {
    pub fn init(allocator: std.mem.Allocator) Store;
    pub fn deinit(self: *Store) void;
    pub fn set(self: *Store, key: []const u8, value: u32) !void;
    pub fn get(self: Store, key: []const u8) ?u32;
    pub fn delete(self: *Store, key: []const u8) bool;
    pub fn size(self: Store) usize;
    pub fn keys(self: Store, allocator: std.mem.Allocator) ![][]const u8;
};
\`\`\`

We're using \`u32\` values for simplicity — the same shape generalises to any \`V\`.

## Ownership rules

The store **owns its keys**. Why? Hash maps don't copy keys, but the caller's input might be a temp buffer. To make \`set\` safe with any caller-provided slice, we \`dupe\` the bytes inside \`set\`. \`delete\` and \`deinit\` free those duplicates.

## Implementation outline

1. Hold a \`std.StringHashMap(u32)\` and the allocator.
2. \`set\`: if the key exists, overwrite (don't dupe again); if not, dupe and insert.
3. \`get\`: thin wrapper around \`map.get\`.
4. \`delete\`: \`fetchRemove(key)\` returns the entry; free the key bytes; report whether anything was removed.
5. \`size\`: \`map.count()\`.
6. \`keys(allocator)\`: allocate a slice and copy the key pointers in.
7. \`deinit\`: walk the map, free each key, then \`map.deinit()\`.

The next lesson is the implementation. Read this one first, then tackle the build.`,

> [!TIP]

- The type system: integers, floats, arrays, slices, strings
- Control flow: if-expressions, switch, for, while, blocks-as-values
- Composition: structs, enums, tagged unions
- Error handling: optionals, error sets, try / catch / errdefer
- Memory: stack vs heap, allocators, ArrayList, StringHashMap
- Metaprogramming: comptime, generics, anytype, type-returning functions

That's enough to ship real Zig code. Where to go next:

## Practice

The Libre library includes the **Zig Challenges** pack — eleven hand-written kata that exercise the basics in tighter form. Same KATA_TEST harness as this course.

## Read

- The [official Zig documentation](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/) — comprehensive language reference, with sections on advanced features (vector types, packed structs, async).
- [Karl Seguin's blog](https://www.openmymind.net/) — the source for much of this course's structure, plus deeper dives into specific topics.
- The [Zig standard library source](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/std/) — well-commented and great for learning idiomatic patterns.

## Build

- A small CLI tool. Parse \`std.os.argv\`, do something useful, exit with a clean status code.
- A web server using [\`zap\`](https://github.com/zigzap/zap) or the built-in \`std.http\`.
- A WebAssembly module — Zig has excellent WASM support out of the box.
- A Zig <-> C library binding. \`@cImport\` is one of the language's quietly powerful features.

## Community

- The official Discord (linked from ziglang.org)
- \`#zig\` on Hacker News and Lobsters tends to surface the best blog posts
- The Zig subreddit and the issue tracker on GitHub

The language is still pre-1.0 — expect some churn between releases — but the core has stabilised enough for production work. Several companies (Bun, TigerBeetle, Roc) have built large systems in Zig and the language has weathered their use well.

Welcome to Zig. Now go write something.`,
